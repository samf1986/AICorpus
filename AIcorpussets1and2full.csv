"COMMENT | If Kuala Lumpur Summit 2019 is a lesser or an ad hoc version of the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC), an event summoned immediately due to extraordinary circumstances affecting the Muslim world, the organisers have unwittingly enhanced the ""Muafakat National"" of Umno and PAS.

These two entities have nothing to contribute to national and international issues except to prey on the religious and racial sentiments of Malays and Muslims and by extension, the Islamic world.

Thus, what is ostensibly a summit to augment the geopolitical standing of Pakatan Harapan on ""Islamic"" issues have, ironically and paradoxically, given ""Muafakat Nasional"" a second and third breath of life.

While empowering the opposition is indeed a noble idea in a democracy, as all democracies do need a challenger to serve as a check and balance, but ""Muafakat Nasional"" is misguided as it aims to manipulate the views of Malays and Muslims. They don't need any assistance, if at all. If anything, they need an immediate intellectual put down.

With global Muslim leaders such as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (below), Indonesian Vice-President Amir Maaruf Amin, and Emir of Qatar Sheikh Amir Al Hamad Al Thamrin and Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan converging in Kuala Lumpur from Dec 17-18, the summit seems to be a strategic event too.

But if the Kuala Lumpur Summit is to become an effective amplifier of all the issues of war, peace and Islamophobia that affect the Muslim world, more thoughts have to be given to ensure their agenda are not wrongly hijacked by nationalist-religious groups. Thus, there is a need to focus on tangible actions that can unite the Muslim world as an alliance of Muslim Nations rather than mere public-relations choreography.

Top Muslim and non-Mulsim scholars such as Professor Cemil Aydin, with a PhD in Middle Eastern and Japanese Studies from Harvard University and now based at the University of North Carolina, should be listened as well as Professor Ho Eng Seng, a world-class expert on Yemini issues, who interestingly hails from Malaysia.

The list can include Georgetown University Professor John Esposito at and London School of Economics Professor Fawaz Gerwez, who have devoted their academic lives to understanding the weaknesses of the Muslim world. Even Professor Jomo Kwame Sundaram, a former member of the Council of Eminent Persons, who has written on Islamic revivalism in the 1980s, should be kept in, rather than left out completely.

A summit is as good as the ""mind melt"" that comes during and after the meeting, not the mere completion of the stand-alone event which makes it a one-off catharsis.

KL Summit 2019, as this is written, also seems to ignore the lessons accumulated at the Alliance of Civilizations (AoC) at the United Nations. AoC was pioneered by Spain and Turkey between 2002-2015.

A co-sponsor of KL Summit would have to be found in the future. Although one would hope that President Hassan Rouhani of Iran would also revive the importance of the ""Dialogue of Civilizations” that was pioneered by his predecessor President Ali Khamenei too, which again can come under the Kuala Lumpur Summit.

Indeed, the Muslim World, if KL Summit is supposed to be a microcosm of it, it is lacking the right depth to talk to each other bilaterally or multilaterally. If the high dialogue is confined to Malaysia, Indonesia, Qatar, Iran and Pakistan to make the Muslim world more dynamic, all-round trade must still be emphasised first to ensure high-quality interaction.

Yet, none of the five countries above trade widely. And if Iran is brought into the picture, one is confronted with international sanctions it still faces, putting a kink into the whole process of the KL Summit. Indeed, as recent as a month ago, Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed confessed that Iranians living in Malaysia are now pressured by external forces not to be given the basic privilege of even having a credit card or bank account in the country. Such sanctions confront any Muslim or non-Muslim countries that want to trade with Iran.

Can the Kuala Lumpur Summit address such a complex issue across the Mulsim world? One would have to assume not right now, as the list of attendants in the Kuala Lumpur Summit did not include anyone from the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia, let alone the Kingdom of Oman, especially representatives who can speak on behalf of Sultan Al Qaboos. The latter has done an excellent job of balancing Sunni-Shia rivalry despite being caught in the middle of the Sunni-Shia quagmire.

The Kuala Lumpur Summit seems to have included Rachid Al Ghanouchi, who believes in the concept of a ""Muslim Democrat"" in the Ummah - not unlike the noticeable absences of PKR president Anwar Ibrahim or Home Minister Muhyiddin Yassin. But the very inclusion of Rachid Ghanouchi of the Ennahda Party in Tunisia also clashes with President Mohammed El Sissi of Egypt.

Therefore, the key is not to stage the whole summit as a diplomatic theatre without further forethought in future. Otherwise, the whiplash effect can be another ""Maruah Melayu"" (Malay dignity) congress which alienated non-Muslims in Malaysia who felt completely left out from the whole event if not insulted since a majority of non-Muslims had backed Harapan to be the government.

As things stand the Kuala Lumpur Summit appears to be an event that seeks to strengthen the relationship of Malaysia, Indonesia, Qatar, Turkey, Pakistan and Iran, not excluding some central Asian republics such as Turkmenistan, where Petronas wants to consolidate its commercial relationship in oil and gas exploration. But nothing more than talk and more talk will emerge if the summit does not first acknowledge that trade between and within Muslim countries remain low.

This would then be a rehash of the problems of the Muslim world and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) since 1967.

As of today, the entire Muslim world only contributes five percent to the global gross domestic product (GDP). If one removes oil and gas from the trade matrix, the figure will go down to as low as less than three percent.

The Kuala Lumpur Summit may try to be the Helsinki of Asia, as the late Nordin Sopiee at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) once called it, but it must be genuine and not staged just for the sake of staging it.

In conclusion, if Kuala Lumpur Summit can point towards a direction to trade more and fight less, especially in fields and sectors that are not in the sunset industries, the event will be a pivotal success.

One will have to see how the summit's organiser, the Malaysian government, avoid the trappings of previous failures. Not forgetting, even Helsinki itself was eclipsed by the great power rivalry between Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato).

One wonders if the organiser of the Kuala Lumpur Summit would in future understand, not merely the complexities of the Muslim world alone but also concerning the non-Muslim community too.

At the very least, the Kuala Lumpur Summit 2019 must be able to talk about the problem of Uyghur Muslims in China, Rohingya refugees trapped in Cox's Bazaar in Bangladesh and the growth of Hindu nationalistic fascism in India. It is a long list and a tall order.

Kuala Lumpur Summit 2019, as all summits dictate, must come up with real solutions and not lofty rhetoric anymore. Perhaps, the summit may surprise all by coming out with resolutions that are pragmatic and workable solutions. You will never know.

But as it stands now, it looks more like a gathering for an end of the year party amongst a few selected friends!

"KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 29 — Malaysia will not arbitrarily issue the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) card to the Rohingyas who have sought refuge in the country, said Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi. Ahmad Zahid, who is also Home Minister, said this was to avoid Malaysia and its people from being overburdened with a flood of Rohingyas fleeing the ethnic clashes in Myanmar. The decision to deny arbitrary granting of the refugee card to the Rohingyas had the cooperation of the UNHCR itself, he said to reporters after handing over sacrificial cows for Aidiladha in his parliamentary constituency of Bagan Datuk, here, today. “Our priority is our people and their welfare. It is not that we are not being humanitarian. I think the international community should show concern for the plight of the Rohingyas,” he said. Ahmad Zahid also asked Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi to restore the image of her country tarnished by the clashes in Rakhine, a state in Myanmar. He said the international community had repeatedly asked Yangon to resolve the humanitarian issue, but it had not been done up to now. “I hope serious attention will be given to this matter. There should be no double standard because of religious differences. Do not make this humanitarian issue a religious and political issue,” he said. He also said that the matter should be settled because Malaysia did not wish to be the receiving country, which had to face an influx of Rohingyas whenever they had problems in Myanmar. — Bernama","[190, 1146, -1, 306, 520, -2, 505]","['{""1.

"In 2018, a Somali refugee boy had walked down from his Selangor apartment to take out the rubbish when he was detained by the authorities for not having his UNHCR card on him.

Despite claiming he had left the card at home, he was later deported back to Somalia where his father had been killed in one of the conflicts going on there.

Meanwhile, in another part of the country, migrant workers work 16 hours, seven days a week in a rubber factory.

They need to seek permission from their employers if they want to leave the premises, and filing leave applications will possibly get them fired.

Such stories are becoming increasingly common in Malaysia, but a recent survey found that migrant workers and refugees face significant challenges in speaking up about their problems - which in turn allows for the perpetuation of injustices.

The above two cases were shared during the launch of the ""Freedom On The Move"" study yesterday.

Commissioned by South Africa-based NGO Civicus, it concluded that most migrant workers (79 percent) and refugees (89 percent) in Malaysia did not feel confident to “criticise or call on authorities to meet their needs”.

ADS

Migrant workers were most afraid of their employers and business owners (46 percent). The survey also noted that some workers felt intimidated to speak up as their employers held on to their passports.

Refugees were most concerned about the police and other state agents (65 percent).

The 82 migrant workers interviewed were from Bangladesh, Nepal, Indonesia and the Philippines. The 65 refugees interviewed were Rohingya (Myanmar), Yemeni, Palestinian and Syrian.

Freedoms limited by employers, language

For migrant workers, the language barrier was the biggest challenge to exercising their freedom of expression (73 percent), followed by a lack of information (47 percent) and a fear of being fired, detained or deported (45 percent).

Similarly, refugees faced significant language barriers (55 percent) but harassment and intimidation were also a serious concern (49 percent).

ADS

The survey further explored challenges the groups faced when exercising other civil liberties.

When it came to freedom of association, it found that 73 percent of migrant workers and 77 percent of working refugees faced “harassment or pressure from employers” in exercising their labour rights.

The survey also noted that some migrant workers were often “coerced” by agents or their employers to refrain from joining a workers' union.

As for freedom of peaceful assembly, most migrant workers did not feel safe participating in street protests (85 percent).

Nevertheless, 62 percent of migrant workers interviewed said they had previously participated in protests or memorandum handovers in Malaysia.

In contrast, refugees had a starkly different experience, with 72 percent saying they had not taken part in any protests. Rohingya refugees were the exception.

Most refugees believed they were not safe (83 percent) and not free (75 percent) to fully exercise their freedom of peaceful assembly.

The survey was part of Civicus’ global study that looked at the perceived civic space of migrant workers and refugees in Malaysia, Mexico, Kenya, Jordan and Germany.

'Human rights don't stop at border'

While fundamental freedoms guaranteed in the Federal Constitution of Malaysia only apply to citizens, Civicus researcher Josef Benedict contended that human rights should extend to all human beings.

Josef Benedict

“Human rights do not stop at the border. When you enter a country and you work from there, you want to be able to voice out opinions if you see something wrong.

“If people are frightened to even raise the issue of ‘why is my pay being cut’ or ‘why am I being laid off from work’; how else can they express these issues?

“These are issues that even Malaysians would want to express if they are affected, so why deny it to migrant workers and refugees?” he told Malaysiakini after the launch of the Civicus report in Petaling Jaya yesterday.

Benedict thus urged Putrajaya to create an enabling environment for migrant workers and refugees to access their rights and freedoms, regardless of their legal status.

He said all bilateral and multilateral agreements between nations should also guarantee these rights and freedoms, and punish violations.

Zero knowledge about rights

A key challenge to empowering migrant workers and refugees was a lack of awareness among the communities about their own rights.

Most Bangladeshi migrant workers to whom North-South Initiative (NSI) social mobiliser Abu Hayat Md Rafiqul Rezvi spoke to for the Civicus survey were poor and with limited levels of education. They also had “zero knowledge” about their fundamental freedoms.

“They did not know anything about the three freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly and association. Only a few workers, maybe one or two, have basic knowledge about unions,” Abu Hayat said during the report launch.

Despite the often terrible working conditions, he said this lack of awareness, coupled with intimidation from employers, caused these workers to be afraid of protesting.

Participating researcher and Syrian refugee Omar Alkhammash shared that most refugees he interviewed were afraid of being identified in the survey, over the fear of repercussions against them.

The Geutanyoe Foundation Malaysia media and communication coordinator explained how many refugees had run away from repressive governments where speaking up against injustices could possibly lead to deadly consequences.

Facing difficulties in a foreign land caused the refugees to continue to stay silent.

“Over here (in Malaysia) refugees are focusing more on healthcare, working rights and education, more than on having civic space.

“But they don’t understand that civic space is the way to lead them into their targets,” Omar said.

The Malaysian government does not officially recognise refugees and regards them as undocumented foreign nationals.

They must pay the higher rates imposed on foreigners at public healthcare facilities and are also not allowed to gain formal employment or enrol in public schools.","[-2, 857, -1, 861, 146, 1052, 981, 1207, 846, 803, 687, 923, 738, 220, 1074]","['{""1.

"A coalition of 17 Rohingya-linked groups based in Myanmar and Malaysia have distanced their community here from purported statements made by the president of the Myanmar Ethnic Rohingya Human Rights Organisation Malaysia, Zafar Ahmad Abdul Ghani.

According to their joint statement, the groups issued an apology to the Malaysian government and Malaysians in general for statements attributed to Zafar (photo) which had sparked ""unprecedented negative sentiments among some Malaysians"" against Rohingya refugees here.

""We, the Rohingya refugees, have never elected Zafar Ahmad as our president, he is not our leader. We have no leader in Malaysia and he has no right to issue statements on our behalf.

""Therefore, all Rohingyas are against such unrealistic and irresponsible statements,"" said the groups.

ADS

They did not refer to any specific remarks allegedly made by Zafar, although they urged that Malaysian authorities take action against him.

Among the undersigned groups include the Rohingya Association in Malaysia, the Rohingya Islamic Society in Malaysia, and Rohingya Youth Care Malaysia.

One of the contact person named in the statement, Muhammad Islam, later insisted that their only ties with Zafar were as a fellow Rohingya.

""We don't have any other ties with him. We don't support him at all,"" said Muhammad, a Rohingya refugee based in Malaysia since 1992.

ADS

Quizzed on the reason behind their joint statement, Muhammad claimed that Zafar could have been ""receiving advise"" from certain parties when speaking up on issues concerning the rights of Rohingya refugees in Malaysia.

The father-of-four, who married a Malaysian, also alluded to social media posts falsely attributed to Zafar which had gone viral.

He indicated no knowledge of Zafar's reported denial of the fake posts, saying instead: ""Zafar can deny it himself.""

On Friday, it was reported that Zafar has been forced to deactivate his Facebook account due to death threats and verbal abuse received, following the circulation of fake social media posts linked to him.

The fake posts quoted him as calling the Malays ""stupid"", demanding equal rights and Malaysian citizenship for Rohingya refugees.

He was also accused of questioning the Malaysian authorities over their refusal to accept boats ferrying Rohingya refugees.

On April 16, the Malaysian authorities prevented 200 Rohingya in a boat from entering the country illegally, although food was provided to all on humanitarian grounds.

They were detected 70 nautical miles west of Langkawi, 11 days after another group of over 200 Rohingya refugees landed on the island and kept in Covid-19 quarantine centres for 14-days.

On Monday, Umno deputy president Mohamad Hasan warned that receiving Rohingya refugees amid the Covid-19 pandemic could open the floodgates for more vessels carrying refugees to encroach Malaysian waters.

The navy's latest move to prevent more entry of Rohingya refugees had sparked a wave of xenophobic and racist comments against the community as a whole.

Also, there is an ongoing online petition campaign urging the government to ignore tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees affected by the movement control order.

"KUALA LUMPUR: A shouting match erupted in the Dewan Rakyat on Monday (July 27) after Mohamad Sabu (PH-Kota Raja) spoke about Malay supremacy and corruption during his speech on the Royal Address. nan The issue began when Mohamad, fondly known as “Mat Sabu”, spoke about how it is dangerous when one particular race is championed without limits, drawing parallels with the United States. nan “What happened in the United States is the best example of white supremacy. It started during the George Washington and (Abraham) Lincoln period, but the peak took place during Donald Trump’s era because his administration was responsible for igniting racial issues. nan “Then chaos happened in the entire United States and even though we are facing a pandemic, the people are still going out to demonstrate, ” said Mohamad, who’s also Parti Amanah Negara (Amanah) president. nan Mohamad then claimed that the concept of white supremacy is the same as Malay supremacy. nan “We don’t see the danger now. It’s still at an early stage. What took place in the United States manifested for over hundreds of years and finally, we see that white supremacy has brought about never-ending chaos that is spreading across the world.” nan Ahmad Fadhli Shaari (PAS-Pasir MAS) subsequently interjected, saying that the former defence minister may have misunderstood the issue as white supremacy and Malay supremacy are two different phrases. nan “Malay supremacy is about rights enshrined in the Constitution, no different than that. That’s it, ” he said. nan Mohamad said he agreed with Ahmad while stating that Muslims leaders should not be supported if they are embroiled in corruption. nan He said support should be given to Muslims with integrity regardless of which party they are from, adding that support should not be given to corrupted Muslim leaders. nan Mohamad’s remarks appeared to have irked Tan Sri Noh Omar (BN-Tanjong Karang), who stood up and said that the Kota Raja MP’s remarks on corruption and the Malays were too general. nan “I feel slighted because I’m a Malay. I support the struggle for Malay rights but to relate them with corruption, it is too general. nan “If you are really fighting for the Malays and Islam, why did you jump from PAS to Amanah? PAS fights for Islam, what is the difference? nan “Who is corrupted here? Do you have evidence? Don’t be so general. YB, you are a Malay, don’t insult the Malays lah. nan “We must have our pride. Don’t insult our race, ” said Noh. nan Mohamad denied that he was insulting the Malays, as he was merely declaring support for more Malays with principles and integrity. nan In response, Noh said he supported Mohamad’s remarks but maintained that corruption should not be associated with Malays. nan “Don’t bring down Malay dignity. YB, you are a good Malay, you are not corrupted. Don’t be like that, ” he said. nan A shouting match subsequently erupted between Noh and several Amanah leaders who came to Mohamad's defence. nan Khalid Samad (PH-Shah Alam) claimed that Noh was particularly incensed when corruption was mentioned by Mohamad. nan Noh subsequently shot back at Khalid, pointing out to the former federal territories minister that his political secretary was investigated by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC). nan “He is just being investigated, not charged yet, ” said Khalid in response to Noh. nan Deputy Speaker Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said subsequently intervened and ended the debate session, where she proceeded to allow Datuk Seri Shafie Apdal (Warisan-Semporna) to deliver his speech on the Royal Address. nan Earlier during Mohamad’s speech, the former defence minister also raised concerns over the way the government had handled the refugee crisis in the past. nan He cited the discovery of mass graves in Wang Kelian, Perlis, as an example. nan “Whoever killed those refugees, it really shamed Malaysia at an international level, ” he added.","[-2, 1174]","['{""1.

"COX’S BAZAR (Bangladesh), Oct 20 ― During Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi’s visit to the Rohingya refugee camp on Monday, he was surrounded by a large number of journalists, a scenario that caught this writer by surprise. Apart from the Malaysian media, scores of local and international journalists including media representatives from some of Asean countries were at the Kutupalong Camp to cover Ahmad Zahid’s visit. An officer of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) at Kutupalong Camp was of the view that the presence of a big number of media representatives covering Ahmad Zahid’s visit was because not many key leaders of a country would come to see the situation at the Rohingya refugee camp, whereas Malaysia was sending its number two leader. Ahmad Zahid’s visit and presence was also giving a clear message to the world that Malaysia was serious about the issue and desired a long-term solution to the ethnic persecution in the Rakhine state of Myanmar. During his one-day visit, Ahmad Zahid met the refugees and witnessed the condition around the camp, which he described as most deplorable compared to other refugee camps he had visited, apart from visiting other facilities provided such as schools and clinics. Ahmad Zahid also announced that Malaysia would build a field hospital to enable more refugees to receive better healthcare. The RM3.5 million field hospital would be built by the Malaysian Armed Forces (MAF) Medical Corps and assisted by the Ministry of Health within a month, once the project met the requirements set by the Bangladesh government. He also wanted the National Security Council (MKN) to coordinate the humanitarian aid efforts – from governments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), media organisations or any individuals - that would be channeled to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. Therefore, all assistance can be streamlined including for the purchase of essential items that are not only limited to food and medical aid. “In terms of food, I saw the United Nations World Food Programme is already there, IOM (International Organisation for Migrants) medicine is also available. So the MKN can think of the other forms of assistance needed,” he told a press conference at Kutupalong Camp. Additionally, he also announced the proposal for Malaysia to place a MKN humanitarian and welfare attache in Bangladesh to implement the government's commitment to help the Rohingya refugees in the camp. Ahmad Zahid said he would submit the proposal during the Cabinet meeting next week so that it could be implemented immediately. This is to ensure that all assistance would reach the target, and to determine the type of assistance that the refugee needed, and when implemented, this will be the first time for Malaysia to place any humanitarian and welfare attache in any country. For a Rohingya refugee, Musa Khalil, 27, Ahmad Zahid’s visit attracted the refugees’ attention as Malaysia was one of the countries that often helped them in the camp here, as there would be some provision that arrived from Malaysia daily. “Many of us here are looking to find a job in Malaysia, but do not realise that as a refugee, we cannot legally work in Malaysia,” said Musa, who could speak in Malay after working in Malaysia from 2009 to 2014. The humanitarian crisis has been steadily escalating in the Rakhine state as more and more ethnic Rohingya fled to Bangladesh daily that resulted in more refugee camps being erected. The actual number of refugees has yet to be ascertained but many parties claimed it has exceeded one million people. For the record, there are only two official refugee camps for the Rohingyas, namely Kutupalong and Nayapara, however, dozens of temporary camps have been erected by the refugees themselves and that number kept increasing daily. ― Bernama","[-2, -1, 402, 946, 880, 1171, 238, 966, 701, 724, 1071]","['{""1.

"PRAGUE: Czechs returned to the polls Saturday for the second day of voting in a presidential run-off pitting pro-Russian incumbent Milos Zeman against liberal pro-European rival Jiri Drahos that promises to go down to the wire.

The election has polarised Czech society, particularly around the issues of immigration and the foreign policy orientation of this former communist NATO and EU member state.

Bookmakers have given veteran populist Zeman the edge, but recent polls have shown the two candidates neck and neck. About 10% of voters remained undecided but polls show they too are split down the middle.

""This is a showdown between two completely different candidates representing two parts of a rather split society,"" political analyst Tomas Lebeda told AFP.

Known for his pro-Chinese and anti-Muslim stance, the populist Zeman took pole position in a field of nine candidates in the Jan 12-13 first round vote, garnering 38.56% of the ballot. Drahos, a former head of the Czech Academy of Sciences (CAS) and a newcomer to politics, scored 26.60%.

A seasoned politician, Zeman represents poorer and rural voters with lower education, while political newcomer Drahos appeals to wealthier, well-educated urbanites.

East vs West

Drahos underscored his concerns about possible Russian meddling in the campaign, saying that ""for (Russian President) Vladimir Putin's regime, NATO is the biggest enemy and we are part of NATO.""

Zeman meanwhile has called on the EU to lift its sanctions on Russia over its 2014 takeover of Crimea from Ukraine.

Voter Daniel Hajek said he would choose Zeman ""because he's opening the door to economic cooperation with countries like Russia and China.

""It's important for us, for jobs; our country is at the heart of Europe — we can't go in just one direction,"" he told AFP in Prague.

Europe's fifth-biggest carmaker is dependent on auto exports, mainly to the eurozone, and its economy is expected to expand by 3.4% this year.

The run-off vote comes amid a wider political crisis as billionaire populist Prime Minister Andrej Babis is fighting police charges of EU subsidy fraud that are hampering his ability to form a government.

Smear campaign?

Zeman's stance on the European Union echoes other populist EU politicians at odds with Brussels over mandatory refugee quotas and various rules which they see as attempts to limit national sovereignty.

Even though the country of 10.6 million people has only received 12 migrants under the EU quota system, migration was a key campaign issue.

Zeman once called the 2015 migrant crisis ""an organised invasion"" of Europe, claiming Muslims were ""impossible to integrate"".

Billboards across the Czech Republic sought to appeal to voters with anti-migrant messages: ""Stop immigrants and Drahos. This is our country. Vote Zeman!""

Running under the slogan ""Decency is a strength,"" Drahos, a 68-year-old professor of chemical engineering who is a newcomer to politics, could not be more different.

A mild-mannered centrist whom critics have branded ""wishy-washy"", Drahos wants Prague to ""play a more active role in the EU"" and backs joining the eurozone.

He is also a critic of the migrant quota system but insists the Czech Republic is strong enough to accept its allotted 2,600 refugees.

Drahos has had to fight off allegations of pedophilia and having been a communist police agent, suggesting the accusations were a smear campaign by Russian intelligence with links to Zeman.

For Prague voter Zdenek Smrcka ""The main issues are decency, humanity, getting rid of this rudeness"" adding that ""the next president should be a man who will create harmony in society"".

The president's role although largely ceremonial is influential. He can name the prime minister and government, central bank board members, judges and university professors, and sign bills passed by parliament into laws.

Polling stations were set to close at 1300 GMT, (9pm Malaysia), with partial results expected to begin rolling in shortly after. — AFP","[-2, 798, 1180]","['{""1. Theme"": None, ""2.

"HELPING communities should not just be about donating goods. nan While short-term help is necessary, community engagement is needed if the objective is to transform lives, said International Medical University (IMU) Community Engagement dean Prof Khoo Suan Phaik. nan The varsity’s community engagement efforts, she said, are increasingly being designed to create more sustainable outcomes for various communities impacted by health inequalities and poverty. nan “One should not go in with one’s agenda of what constitutes giving or engaging without focusing on the real, broader issues such as accumulative health issues arising from inaccessible health services. nan “Community engagement provides experiential learning for students and we need to do more. We must enable communities to be proactive, empowering them to create or seize opportunities,“ she added in a press release. nan As part of the varsity’s community engagement efforts through its IMU Cares platform, the Kachin community in the country was gifted with 10 sewing machines during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. nan More recently, IMU Cares has teamed up with Uniqlo and the Women’s Aid Organisation to establish the Digital Literacy and Entrepreneurship for Women Programme, which would help increase women’s capacity towards building resilience and financial independence. nan This is a six-month programme that will deliver a series of workshops to 20 women from refugee communities and those from shelter homes and low-cost-housing within the Klang Valley. nan Through this initiative, the Kachin women who benefited from the sewing machines will be able to pick up some information technology skills, hence enabling them to expand their skills from product making to product merchandising, Prof Khoo said, adding that this year will see the varsity continuing to focus on specific issues faced by vulnerable communities. nan Htoi San Nhkum, also known as Sam, who is a refugee from Myanmar heading the Kachin Refugee Centre, said refugees do not want to rely on handouts and want to work towards self-efficacy. nan “While we are always grateful to our host country Malaysia and have gained from so much help and support, we also want to be independent and secure a better future for ourselves. We want to prepare for our lives beyond the restrictions we now face,” she said. nan “We could start making side income from sewing now, but we really need to improve the quality of our products so we can sell. We also need help with marketing,” she added. nan During the pandemic, the Kachin women, having undergone training arranged by IMU, made 17,000 face masks, over 1,000 head covers and 75 disposable gowns, which were donated to frontliners. nan The sewing project gave the refugee women an income, which compensated for the loss of casual work during the lockdown. nan But for Sam and her community, it was not just about the immediate income, but also the potential that the 10 sewing machines promised, which enabled them to think of future projects. nan At the International Women’s Day celebration held at IMU in March, the Kachin women demonstrated their enthusiasm, while displaying an array of handmade items which were produced for the sewing project during the pandemic. nan As of last January, there were 181,510 refugees and asylum-seekers registered with the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR in Malaysia. nan Some 155,610 were from Myanmar, comprising 103,560 Rohingyas, 22,580 Chins, and 29,470 other ethnic groups from conflict-affected areas or fleeing persecution in the country. nan The remaining individuals were 25,900 refugees and asylum-seekers from 50 countries fleeing war and persecution in countries including Yemen and Syria.","[-2, 940, 4, -1, 732, 1133, 927, 964]","['{""1.

"PUTRAJAYA: There is a plan by the Home Ministry to issue its own refugee card instead of allowing the one by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), says its Minister Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin. nan “We are looking for a way to only accept refugee cards issued by agencies under the Home Ministry, not by the UNHCR. nan “Who’s to say these cards issued by UNHCR are even valid?” the Home Minister told reporters yesterday. nan Hamzah said the power to provide asylum to Rohingya refugees in the country should only be given to Malaysian authorities, not other third-party agencies. nan He said many Rohingya refugees in the country claimed they were registered by the UNHCR, but the authenticity of their claims was questionable. nan “The sole registration agency in the country is the National Registration Department (NRD), led by its director-general Datuk Ruslin Jusoh. He is the most legitimate registrar of individuals in the country. nan “Why should there be a different entity registering individuals in our country?” said Hamzah at the press conference at the ministry. nan “It is Malaysia who should have the sole authority to decide if an individual can live in the country legally through cards issued by its own agency.” nan He said the status of Rohingya refugees in the country was a long-standing issue and currently, about 150,000 were already registered with the UNHCR. nan He said the people of this country need to understand that the government did not detain individuals seeking asylum entering with valid documents. nan “Those who fled Syria or Afghanistan and entered our country with valid passports, we do not detain them and put them in depots. nan “But those who enter illegally, they are breaching our immigration laws. If someone breaks into your house without invitation, are they committing an offence? Or do you just let them in? nan “But if someone you know seeks shelter and asks to stay at your place because they are fleeing from someone, you would be fine to allow them in. nan “This is a simple analogy that the people need to understand before criticising the government for rounding up illegals. We do it because they broke our laws,” said Hamzah. nan In the April 20 incident where 528 detainees rioted and broke out of the Relau immigration detention centre, Hamzah said there were 61 individuals still on the run. nan On calls by residents in the nearby Sungai Bakap area for the government to close the depot due to security concerns, Hamzah said it would be looked into.","[-1, 213, -2, 1105, 833, 1111, 1148, 1205]","['{""1.

"(Adds Biden on potential sanctions, UK's Johnson)

* U.N. Security Council to meet Tuesday

* State of emergency to last a year

* Junta replaces key ministers

* West condemns, ponders next steps

Feb 2 (Reuters) - Western leaders condemned the coup by Myanmar's military against Aung San Suu Kyi's democratically elected government and hundreds of thousands of her supporters took to social media to voice their anger at the takeover.

In the early hours of Monday, the Myanmar army handed power to military chief General Min Aung Hlaing and imposed a state of emergency for a year, saying it had responded to what it called election fraud.

The sudden turn of events derailed years of efforts to establish democracy in poverty-stricken Myanmar, also known as Burma, and raised more questions over the prospect of how and when a million Rohingya refugees will return to the country.

The U.N. Security Council will meet on Tuesday, diplomats said, amid calls for a strong response to the detention of Suu Kyi and dozens of her political allies, although Myanmar's close ties with council member China will play into any decision.

U.S. President Joe Biden said the coup was a direct assault on Myanmar's transition to democracy and the rule of law.

""The United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based on progress toward democracy. The reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws and authorities, followed by appropriate action,"" Biden said in a statement.

Min Aung Hlaing, who had been nearing retirement, promised a free and fair election and a handover of power to the winning party, without giving a timeframe.

Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party, which won a landslide 83% in a Nov. 8 election, said that she called on people to protest against the military takeover, quoting comments it said were written earlier in anticipation of a coup.

But the streets were quiet overnight after troops and riot police took up positions in the capital, Naypyitaw, and the main commercial centre Yangon. Phone and internet connections were disrupted.

Many in Myanmar voiced their anger on social media.

Data on Facebook showed more than 334,000 people had used the #SaveMyanmar hashtag denoting opposition to the coup, and some people changed profile pictures to black to show their sorrow or red in support of the NLD, often with a portrait of the 75-year-old Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner.

""We as a citizen of Myanmar not agree with the current move and would like to request the world leaders. UN and the world medias help our country - our leaders - our people - from this bitter acts,"" said one widely reposted message.

Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other NLD leaders were ""taken"" in the early hours of Monday morning, NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt told Reuters by phone. U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said at least 45 people had been detained.

MINISTERS REMOVED

The United Nations led condemnation of the coup and calls for the release of detainees and restoration of democracy in comments largely echoed by Australia, the European Union, India, Japan and the United States.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, the former colonial power in Burma, called for the release of Suu Kyi and others. ""The vote of the people must be respected and civilian leaders released,"" he said.

Consolidating the coup, the junta removed 24 ministers and named 11 replacements to oversee ministries including finance, defence, foreign affairs and interior.

Banks said they would reopen on Tuesday after suspending services on Monday amid a rush to withdraw cash.

Yangon residents rushed to stock up on supplies. Foreign companies from Japanese retail company Aeon to South Korean trading firm POSCO International and Norway's Telenor tried to reach staff in Myanmar and assess the turmoil.

Suu Kyi's election win followed about 15 years of house arrest between 1989 and 2010 and a long struggle against the military, which had seized power in a 1962 coup and stamped out all dissent for decades until her party came to power in 2015.

Her international standing as a human rights icon was severely damaged after she failed to stop the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas in 2017 and defended the military against accusations of genocide. But she remains hugely popular at home and is revered as the daughter of Myanmar's independence hero, Aung San.

'BROKEN WINGS'

The coup followed days of tension between the civilian government and the military. In the pre-written statement on Facebook, Suu Kyi was quoted as saying that an army takeover would put Myanmar ""back under a dictatorship"".

""I urge people not to accept this, to respond and wholeheartedly to protest against the coup by the military,"" it said. Reuters was unable to reach any NLD officials to confirm the veracity of the statement.

Supporters of the military celebrated the coup, parading through Yangon in pickup trucks and waving national flags.

Democracy activists and NLD voters were horrified and angry. Four youth groups condemned the coup in statements and pledged to ""stand with the people"" but did not announce specific action.

""Our country was a bird that was just learning to fly. Now the army broke our wings,"" student activist Si Thu Tun said.

In the capital, security forces confined members of parliament to residential compounds on the day they had expected to take up their seats, representative Sai Lynn Myat said.

Beijing called on all sides in Myanmar to respect the constitution and uphold stability, but ""noted"" events in the country rather than expressly condemning them.

Bangladesh, which is sheltering around one million Rohingya, called for ""peace and stability"" and said it hoped a process to repatriate the refugees could move forward.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Myanmar is a member, called for ""dialogue, reconciliation and the return to normalcy"" while in Bangkok, police clashed with a group of pro-democracy demonstrators outside Myanmar's embassy.

""It's their internal affair,"" a Thai government official said - a hands-off approach also taken by Malaysia and the Philippines.

The November vote faced some criticism in the West for disenfranchising many Rohingya but the election commission rejected military complaints of fraud.

In its statement declaring the emergency, the military cited the failure of the commission to address complaints over voter lists, its refusal to postpone new parliamentary sessions, and protests by groups unhappy with the vote.

"INTERVIEW | Having been based in Kuala Lumpur for 14 years, international broadcaster Al Jazeera's '101 East' weekly current affairs programme team is no stranger to challenges in reporting from the region.

The latest series of attacks that follow its 'Locked up in Malaysia’s Lockdown' episode is however unexpected, according to Al Jazeera English Channel's managing director Giles Trendle.

""The ‘101 East’ team has covered some tough stories in the past,"" Trendle said in a phone interview from Al Jazeera's head office in Qatar.

ADS

""We did a film called ‘Murder in Malaysia’ about the murder of the Mongolian woman [Altantuya Shaariibuu] and one of our journalists was deported from Malaysia before that episode went out.

""There have been issues in the past but nothing at this level that we are currently facing,"" he said.

Trendle was referring to Australian journalist Mary Ann Jolley who was abruptly deported in 2015 after the Home Ministry deemed her activity as having a ""potential negative effect on the image of Malaysia"".

Al Jazeera English was set up in 2006 as an extension of its Arabic language programming and Trendle said Kuala Lumpur has been the right location for its ‘101 East’ production team which covers ""untold stories"" from the Asia-Pacific region.

ADS

At the same time, he cited Al Jazeera's concerns over rapidly shrinking media freedom, particularly on the criminalisation of journalism.

""Yes, we are concerned about media freedom in Malaysia. We are concerned with journalists being treated as criminals. One of our slogans is journalism is not a crime,"" said Trendle.

Seven Al Jazeera staff (below) were summoned to Bukit Aman for questioning earlier this month and Trendle said the management is still waiting for an update on the status of the case.

""We are concerned that journalists are called in for a criminal investigation. We don't believe we have done anything wrong. We are ready to stand up and say that our journalism is fair, balanced, and impartial,"" he said.

Since the release of 'Locked up in Malaysia’s Lockdown', some netizens have taken to social media to call out alleged misrepresentation of facts in the report, with demands for the reporters to be deported.

Aside from online attacks and a police probe, Al Jazeera is also under the scrutiny of the Communications and Multimedia Ministry, with the National Film Development Corporation (Finas) recently declaring a licence is required for the production of its show.

ADS

Amid backlash over licensing requirements under the Finas Act 1981, Communications and Multimedia Minister Saifuddin Abdullah yesterday affirmed government’s commitment to media freedom and individual rights on social media.

Comments section disabled

Meanwhile, Trendle cited the ongoing contempt of court trial against Malaysiakini and editor-in-chief Steven Gan as the reason behind Al Jazeera's move to disable the viewer comments section on the July 3 episode.

""Al Jazeera was criticised for not enabling comments on the website of the film page but we disabled the comments because of Malaysiakini's case.

""We do not want to be liable for any offensive or racist comments that might be seen as being critical and therefore be in a situation like Malaysiakini is at the moment,"" he said.

Overall, he reiterated Al Jazeera's commitment to ""fair, impartial, and balanced"" journalism, including efforts to contact relevant authorities and ministries, despite being ""rejected or ignored"".

Aside from being open to clarifications from any local authorities, Trendle noted that he also prepared for a pre-arranged interview with national news agency Bernama yesterday but was later told it had been cancelled.

""I had agreed to speak to them. I was very happy and everything was set up but we learned not too long ago that the interview was not going to happen,"" he said.

On the safety of sources, Trendle said Al Jazeera's procedure would be to always get their consent first on the way they would be filmed, either on record or with their identity hidden.

In this case, he said Bangladeshi migrant Md Rayhan Kabir had consented to be interviewed on the record but the ""witch hunt"" against him was regrettable.

Following the outcry, the Immigration Department announced a search for Rayhan, 25, and later moved to revoke his work permit.

Public sentiment against refugees and migrants have intensified since the movement control order (MCO) was imposed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, with hateful comments proliferating on the Internet.

NGOs said the crackdown by the authorities against undocumented foreign citizens during the MCO, some of whom had contracted the disease due to living in closed quarters, has also exacerbated negative sentiments against refugees and migrants.

"KUALA LUMPUR: Syrian refugee, Hassan al Kontar will get a new lease of life in Canada after living in Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (klia2) for six months.

Hassan who landed in Canada at 10.30am today has been granted permanent resident status under Canada’s “Private Sponsorship of Refugees” (PSR) program, said his lawyer Datuk Seri M. Ramachelvan.

The Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program is a Canadian initiative established in 1978 under Operation Lifeline, whereby refugees can resettle in Canada with support and funding from private or joint government-private sponsorship.

Al Kontar’s Canadian legal representative Andrew Brouwer could not be reached for comments.

Al Kontar had on Monday posted a video on Twitter from the Taiwan International Airport that he was on his way to Vancouver, Canada.

“For now, it’s not important where I have been or what went on ... What is important is today and tomorrow. The present and the future,“ he said on Twitter.

“I could not do it without the support and prayers from all of you. I could not do it without the help of my family, my Canadian friend’s family, my lawyer. Thank you all,“ he added.

Al-Kontar was arrested at the klia2 almost seven months after being stranded when officials refused to let him board a flight to Ecuador, on March 7.

The 36-year-old was left stranded in the terminal, surviving on donated airline meals and washing up in the toilets.

Al-Kontar, reportedly sought by authorities in his homeland for failing to serve in the military, was also refused entry into Cambodia and not allowed back into Malaysia due to visa issues.","[1181, -2, 877, 862, -1]","['{""1.

"* Rights groups say deportation plan could endanger lives

* Court had granted stay until 10 a.m. on Wed

* Decision to deport 'inhumane and devastating' - Amnesty

* Malaysia says it did not deport refugees or asylum seekers (Adds statement from Amnesty)

By A. Ananthalakshmi and Rozanna Latiff

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Malaysia sent more than 1,000 Myanmar nationals back to their strife-torn homeland on Tuesday despite a court order to halt the deportation, a move rights groups said could endanger the deportees' lives.

The 1,086 Myanmar citizens were sent back on three navy ships sent by Myanmar's military, which seized power in a Feb. 1 coup, sparking weeks of protests from pro-democracy activists. Malaysia had initially said it would deport 1,200.

Malaysia vowed not to deport Rohingya Muslims or refugees registered with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

But the agency has said at least six people registered with it were among the deportees. Refugee groups also say asylum seekers from the minority Chin, Kachin and non-Rohingya Muslim communities fleeing conflict and persecution at home are among those being deported.

Malaysia's Immigration Department director-general said the repatriated Myanmar citizens did not include Rohingya refugees or asylum-seekers.

""All of those returned had agreed to be sent back voluntarily without being forced by any party,"" Khairul Dzaimee Daud said in a statement.

He did not respond to queries on why the repatriation was carried out despite the court-ordered halt.

The Kuala Lumpur High Court had granted a stay until 10 a.m. on Wednesday, when it was scheduled to hear an application by rights groups for a judicial review to suspend the deportation.

Just before the ruling, the migrants were bussed in from across the country to the naval base at Lumut in western Malaysia where the Myanmar ships were docked.

'INHUMANE AND DEVASTATING'

Those deported had been detained for immigration offences. Malaysia does not formally recognise refugees, treating them as undocumented migrants.

Amnesty International, one of the groups which requested the judicial review, called the decision to deport without a proper assessment of the returnees ""inhumane and devastating"".

""Using indirect means to push people back to face grave human rights violations is essentially constructive refoulement,"" Katrina Maliamauv, Amnesty Malaysia director, said in a statement.

""There are still huge, deeply concerning question marks over the status of those sent back today.""

The rights groups in their court filing had said among the deportees were three people registered with the UNHCR and 17 minors who have at least one parent in Malaysia.

Concerns over deportation of unregistered asylum-seekers have persisted, as UNHCR has not been allowed to interview detainees for more than a year to verify their status. The Southeast Asian nation is home to more than 154,000 asylum-seekers from Myanmar.

The UNHCR had not been allowed access to those deported on Tuesday.

The United States and other Western missions have been trying to dissuade Malaysia from proceeding with the deportation and urged the government to allow UNHCR to interview the detainees. They also say Malaysia is legitimising the military government by cooperating with the junta.

"KOTA KINABALU: Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister, Datuk Mohamaddin Ketapi said museum entrance fees in the country need to be reviewed since it is relatively low compared to other countries.

He said when compared to museums in other countries, entrance fees for museums in the country were too low at only RM5 compared to entrance fees of up to 15 dollars in foreign countries.

“Therefore, I think the entrance fees should be increased slightly for example RM10 and consider it as a contribution to further upgrade museums in the country,“ he said after officiating the International Museum Day 23rd national celebration at the Sabah Museum Complex here.

Mohamaddin said the occasion provided a platform for further cooperation between museums in the effort to spread knowledge about the country’s cultural heritage.

“This celebration is also a recognition of the role of museums in the shaping of communities and countries, as well as strengthening cooperation networks among museums across Malaysia,“ he said.

Mohamaddin said the achievements and efforts of the museum institutions in the digital age should be upgraded to change the perception of the community on heritage and culture.

He said museums needed to be a cultural hub capable of blending heritage and technology through a dedicated mechanism that is solid in preserving the country’s culture and heritage for the continuity of tradition.

“As a cultural hub, museum activities need not only rely on collections alone, but society should be the essence towards achieving excellence in the museum institutions. Museums should creatively incorporate ideas together with the community in drafting programmes according to current trends.

“Museums should also be able to highlight current issues through organising various programmes not only in the form of exhibitions, but also dialogues, forums and so on,“ he said.

He said the museum not only serves as an institution that preserves heritage treasures in the form of artifacts and documentation, but it also extends its role as an agent capable of creating awareness among the public about the importance of the museum as a hub in understanding the culture and traditions of a society. - Bernama",[-2],"['{""1.

"NOV 9 — World leaders from the 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meet this week in Vietnam. It is clear that the first part of this year’s theme – “Creating new dynamism” – cannot be achieved without placing a firm emphasis on the second – “fostering a shared future.” The future we share just within APEC encompasses 40 percent of the world’s population, 54 percent of global GDP and 44 percent of world trade. Given its scale, this grouping is ideally positioned to enhance the well-being of our citizens, both in the economic and social realms. And also to address the many challenges the world currently faces – that threaten not just the future but the present. For we face huge challenges in Asia Pacific: from rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula, to the scourge of Daesh and its regional affiliates in Southeast Asia, to the suffering and persecution that has caused unprecedented mass migration in the Andaman Sea and in neighbouring countries. A gathering of world leaders, such as this one, must take advantage of being together to consider what we all collectively can do to take action. For Malaysia’s part, we have been consistent in our strong condemnation of the series of nuclear tests that have been conducted by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). An escalation that could lead to nuclear catastrophe, with the consequent deaths of hundreds of thousands, if not millions; the radioactive fallout, devastating long-term illnesses and mass displacement of people – this is something we simply cannot contemplate in the 21st century. Any conflict, particularly one involving such weapons, would be catastrophic not just for the Korean peninsula but for the region and beyond. Nuclear armageddon was a threat that blighted far too much of the second half of the last century, and we must take all steps necessary to avoid these dark clouds shrouding the first half of the current century. Earlier this year, Malaysia faced an intolerable violation of our territorial sovereignty when Kim Jong-nam was assassinated on our soil with banned chemical weapons. We took immediate action, sending back the DPRK diplomatic officers who were in Malaysia, and are conducting a broader review of our links with North Korea including diplomatic, political and economic relations, as well as the possibility of closing our embassy in Pyongyang. More broadly, we have long advocated for the DPRK to fully comply with all relevant UN Security Council resolutions and for the six party talks framework to be resumed. A peaceful conclusion to the tensions on the Peninsula would be a greater prize for the whole world, and as such, we welcome President Donald Trump’s statement that “it makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and make a deal”. We hope that his efforts, and those of President Xi Jinping, may lead to a more constructive path forward and we strongly support a peaceful future in Northeast Asia. In terms of Daesh, we have not been spared the shadow of a barbarity that has wrought such wicked havoc in Iraq and Syria. Indeed, in June last year, there was the first Daesh-linked attack in Malaysia. Although several were injured, mercifully no one died. It is only thanks to the heroic efforts of the Royal Malaysia Police that 16 attacks on Malaysian soil have been foiled, including two during the Southeast Asian Games closing ceremony and our National Day celebrations at Merdeka Square. But we cannot, and will not, let our vigilance lapse. On the international level, we are proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with so many other nations in the Global Coalition Against Daesh. At home, the Government has introduced a raft of counter-terrorism legislation over the past few years, so we have not found ourselves – as some other countries have – in the position of not having the appropriate laws to deal with this scourge. For when we see what happened in Marawi City in the Philippines recently, it is clear that this is a threat that is real and present in our region. Nobody should underestimate it, and I will never apologise for putting the safety and security of the Malaysian people first. But this challenge needs to be dealt with in a number of ways: not just by prevention, but also by battling radicalisation and working to rehabilitate those who have been falsely lured away by criminals who blaspheme the name of Islam. Our efforts to promote the concept of wasatiyyah, and the example set by our Global Movement of Moderates initiative, have been widely recognised and taken as a model by other countries. This was confirmed earlier this year by the establishment in Malaysia of the King Salman Centre for International Peace – a wonderful endorsement by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. Religion should be about peace, brotherhood and mutual respect. Alas, that has not been the case in Myanmar’s Rakhine State, where it is plain for the world to see that a campaign of ethnic cleansing has taken place against the Rohingya, a community that has suffered such terrible atrocities that a substantial proportion of them have fled the land they call home. Such persecution not just leads to refugee influxes for neighbouring countries, but also incites radicalisation and regional instability. Malaysia was one of the first countries to call for action. It was Malaysia that successfully proposed the meeting of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) foreign ministers in Yangon last December. We hosted the Extraordinary Session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation Council of Foreign Ministers to discuss the plight of the Rohingya in January this year. And we have led numerous humanitarian initiatives, sending goods and establishing a field hospital to help Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. I was glad to see that after we raised the issue with President Trump during my visit to the White House in September, his administration has been taking an increasingly tough line on the tragedy that has unfolded in Myanmar. Faced with all these security challenges, we cannot stand by and do nothing. The Malaysian Government will always push for efforts to ensure peace, stability and security in Asia Pacific. We must all contribute to “fostering a shared future”, and I hope and pray that after the APEC summit and subsequent ASEAN and related summits, we will have made strong progress in doing so.","[0, -2, -1, 593, 449, 444]","['{""1.

This year has had far more activity,” says Kyaw Win, executive director of London-based Burma Human Rights Network who coordinates research from Myanmar-based teams. nan nan nan “The (trafficking) networks are not being thwarted as often by the authorities in Bangladesh and Burma,” said Kyaw Win, referring to Myanmar by its former name. nan nan nan “The demand is far higher now due to the massive population increase in the refugee camps and a widespread sense of hopelessness among many of the refugees who have no idea when they will have a place they can live freely.” nan nan nan On Feb 11, at least 15 Rohingya drowned after an overloaded boat on its way to Malaysia sank off Bangladesh. nan nan nan The next day, 48 Rohingya on a similar journey were detained by the Myanmar navy in the sea. nan nan nan In an urgent statement issued on Tuesday (Feb 18), independent experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council sounded the alarm about the mounting civilian death toll and displacement caused by fighting between the military and the Arakan Army. nan nan nan This came amid the information blackout caused by the suspension of mobile Internet services in huge swathes of Rakhine state as well as neighbouring Chin state. nan nan nan “We are gravely concerned that children are being killed and injured, and that reports suggest weapons are being used indiscriminately, and precautions are not being taken to protect civilians and civilian objects such as schools and monasteries, in violation of international humanitarian law,” the experts said in the statement. nan nan nan “We note that the International Court of Justice ordered the provisional measures in relation to the Rohingya minority and they must be followed.” nan nan nan Rohingya Muslims, rejected in Myanmar as colonial-era interlopers from present-day Bangladesh, cannot travel freely around Rakhine state and the country, which severely limits their access to health facilities, education opportunities and livelihoods. nan nan nan In 2017, Rohingya insurgents attacked security bases, triggering a brutal crackdown by the Myanmar military likened to ethnic cleansing which forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh. nan nan nan Last year, the mostly Muslim African nation Gambia lodged a case with the International Court of Justice alleging that Myanmar committed genocide. nan nan nan While the case may take years to conclude, the court last month ruled in favour of Gambia’s request for provisional measures to require Myanmar to protect the Rohingya from more harm. nan nan nan Myanmar has acknowledged that war crimes took place, but insisted there was no genocide. nan nan nan Myanmar’s Ministry of Transport and Communications, citing “security requirements and public interest”, suspended mobile Internet services in Maungdaw, Buthidaung, Rathedaung and Myebon in Rakhine State and in Paletwa in Chin State on Feb 3. nan nan nan The suspension widened an Internet blackout that already applied to four other townships in Rakhine state. nan nan nan Since then, the experts noted, at least seven civilians have been killed, including three Rohingya in Buthidaung, and up to 50 injured. nan nan nan Those injured included 21 children who came under fire while at their school in Buthidaung. nan nan nan More than 660,000 of around 850,000 people identified by the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in need of humanitarian assistance this year live in Rakhine state. nan nan nan UN agencies face mounting hurdles trying to provide emergency food aid, primary healthcare services and education support in Rakhine state. nan nan nan “Access to people in need is often constrained due to insecurity or bureaucratic issues, which complicates efforts to carry out assessments, provide assistance and monitor impact,” the UN told The Straits Times. nan nan nan Meanwhile, restrictions on movement mean that the Rohingya are less likely than other groups to get the help they need. nan nan nan “It’s been getting worse these two years,” said Hla Tun, 35, a Rohingya living in Maungdaw, in a phone interview. nan nan nan “When the Rohingya get caught in the crossfire, we don’t even have the chance to send injured villagers to the hospital on time.” – The Straits Times/Asia News Network nan nan nan nan nan Article type: metered User Type: anonymous web User Status: Campaign ID: 1 Cxense type: free User access status: 0 nan Subscribe now to our Premium Plan for an ad-free and unlimited reading experience!","[490, -1, 486, 860, -2, 346, 341, 1084, 548, 558, 443, 580, 599, 417]","['{""1.

"KUALA LUMPUR, July 21 — A Malaysian court today will hear a bid to set aside caning sentences handed down to 27 Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar, lawyers said, a punishment that rights groups have decried as vicious and tantamount to torture. Muslim-majority Malaysia has long been a favoured destination for Rohingya seeking a better life after escaping a 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar and, more recently, refugee camps in Bangladesh. But Malaysia, which does not recognise refugee status, has recently turned away boats and detained hundreds of Rohingya, saying it can not take in more migrants because of a struggling economy as a result of the novel coronavirus. In June, a court on Malaysia’s Langkawi island sentenced 40 Rohingya refugees to seven months’ jail for arriving in the country by boat without a valid permit, Collin Andrew, a lawyer representing the refugees, told Reuters today. Twenty-seven men among them were also sentenced to caning, a penalty that Andrew was seeking to overturn in court tomorrow. The immigration department and the attorney-general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Under Malaysia’s Immigration Act, anyone who illegally enters the country can face a RM10,000 fine, jail for up to five years as well as six strokes of a cane. Courts can choose not to hand down the caning sentence on humanitarian grounds if the migrant charged is a refugee and does not have any prior criminal history, Andrew said. “So it’s quite unusual for the court to impose caning against Rohingya in this case,” he said. The rights group Amnesty International this week urged Malaysia not to cane the refugees, saying it was “cruel and inhumane”. Lawyers have also sought a review of a case against six Rohingya teenagers, including two girls, who Andrew said had been wrongly tried and convicted as adults. This month, the court had dismissed a case against 51 Rohingya minors who were also charged for violating immigration laws, he said. — Reuters",,,Malaysian court to hear bid to set aside caning for Rohingya refugees,,0,1,0
"PUTRAJAYA: The pilot project initiated by the government to allow Rohingya refugees to work legally in Malaysia will begin on March 1.

Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said the project would allow 300 Rohingya United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) card holders to work in stages.

He said the selected refugees would have to pass security and health screening before being allowed to enter the country's workforce.

""The refugees would be assigned to selected companies in the plantation and manufacturing sectors to provide them with the skills and a source of income before they are relocated to a third country,"" he said.

Ahmad Zahid said this in a statement after chairing the high level committee meeting on issues related to the UNHCR at Perdana Putra here.

He also said the National Security Council (NSC) is in the midst to improve its Order no. 23 to ensure a smoother and more organised handling of UNHCR card holders currently residing in Malaysia.

NSC Order no. 23 deals with the mechanism to manage illegal immigrants which outlines measures to reduce the number of illegals in Malaysia.

""The government is always looking for the best approach to manage UNHCR card holders despite the country not being a member to the UN's 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol,"" he said.

Ahmad Zahid also announced the formation of a joint task force to manage issues pertaining to refugees effectively.

""The task force would involve the cooperation of six ministries with the UNHCR to ensure the validity of the UNHCR cards issued,"" he said.

Ahmad Zahid said currently there were a total of 149,474 documented UNHCR card holders from 62 countries in Malaysia.

"ROHINGYA refugees received emergency medical treatment after a boat carrying nearly 200 people came ashore in Indonesia yesterday, authorities said, in the fourth such landing in the country in recent months.

Each year thousands of the mostly Muslim Rohingya, heavily persecuted in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, risk their lives on long, expensive sea journeys – often in poor-quality vessels – in an attempt to reach Malaysia or Indonesia.

The wooden vessel arrived around 5.30pm (1030 GMT) on a beach in Indonesia’s westernmost province of Aceh, said local police spokesman Winardy.

“One hundred and eighty-five Rohingya immigrants landed in Pidie (district). The figure consists of 83 adult males, 70 adult females and 32 children,” Winardy, who goes by one name, said in a statement.

The refugees were temporarily sheltered at a local facility, with health workers treating those who were sick, Winardy added.

Some appeared very weak and thin and were put on drips by medical staff, according to AFP journalists.

A health worker told AFP some were “suffering from severe dehydration. Some children were vomiting.”

Details on the length and conditions of their journey were not immediately available, but one young arrival said they had set off from Bangladesh.

“We came from a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh in a hope that Indonesia will give us the opportunity of education,” 14-year-old Umar Faruq said.

Marfian, a leader of a local fishing community on the scene not long after the refugees arrived, said that “some refugees landed in weak conditions”.

“When they were at the shoreline, locals helped by giving them food,” Marfian said.

He noted that in recent years some Acehnese fishermen had helped Rohingya boats come ashore but the latest boat was carried to land by the wind, as fishermen had become more reluctant to help.

Winardy underscored that authorities were coordinating on refugee response “considering their landing in Aceh has become more frequent”.

Monday’s boat landing in Aceh came a day after another vessel carrying 57 Rohingya refugees came ashore in the province after a month at sea.

In November, two boats carrying a total of 229 Rohingya landed in the same province, according to the UN refugee agency UNHCR.

Relatively affluent Malaysia is a favoured destination for the refugees, but many land first in Muslim-majority Indonesia, seen as more welcoming.

UN agencies and human rights groups have called on states in the region for urgent help after several boats carrying Rohingya were reported adrift for weeks in the Indian ocean.

The UNHCR said over the weekend that some 180 Rohingya at sea for weeks were feared dead, after relatives said they’d lost contact and presumed none on board had survived. – AFP, December 27, 2022.",,,Rohingya refugees get emergency treatment after boat lands in Indonesia,,0,1,0
"PETALING JAYA: Unfounded claims of Rohingya refugees are demanding Malaysian citizenship are shared on social media.

Pictures of Shah Alam MP Khalid Samad with Rohingya rights activist Zafar Ahmad Abdul Ghani then went viral. One netizen posted the photograph with the caption ‘Pakatan Harapan loves Rohingya’, drawing a response from Khalid on twitter.

“Yes, PH stands with the oppressed and abused. It’s mandatory under Islam,“ said Khalid in response.

Khalid is not alone in standing up for the Rohingya refugees. Lynette Lee who teaches refugee students at a local NGO expressed her concerns as well.

“Firstly, it’s extremely difficult for refugees to get citizenship in Malaysia. It takes years and there are alot of steps,” Lee told theSun.

“Even getting their refugee cards from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is difficult, and even when they do get it, it offers them little to no protection and rights.”

Lee said Malaysians should stop expressing hate towards refugees as they come from war-torn countries.

“Malaysians are privileged enough to come from a peaceful country with rights and education,” she said.

“The refugee children I teach don’t have such a privilege. While some Malaysian students are celebrating the fact that school is closed, the refugees I teach are begging to go back to school. “

When asked if the xenophobic rhetoric among Malaysians would affect her job as a teacher, she said she’s only worried about her students.

"KUALA LUMPUR, March 1 — Thirty-four Rohingya were found on a beach in Malaysia today, police said, the first of the Muslim minority group thought to have arrived in the country by sea for almost a year. About 740,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar for Bangladesh after a military clampdown in August 2017, joining huge numbers already confined to camps. Local police officer Nahar Jalaluddin told AFP the Rohingya were discovered on an isolated stretch of coast in the northern state of Perlis. “They were tired, weak and hungry,” he said. “The refugees, who included men, women and children, are now in the custody of the immigration authorities.” The official said he suspected they had been ferried into Malaysian waters from neighbouring Thailand by people smugglers under cover of darkness, and dumped close to the shore. The New Straits Times newspaper reported that villagers found the Rohingya on the shore covered with mud, and many were crying. It is the first time since April 2018 that Malaysian authorities have found a group of Rohingya who made it to the country by sea. It was not clear whether they had started their journey in Myanmar or Bangladesh, where huge numbers of Rohingya are living in squalid refugee camps. Bangladesh security forces have stopped repeated attempts by smugglers to transport Rohingya to Malaysia by boat.

According to the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, there are 54,856 registered Rohingya refugees and asylum-seekers in Malaysia as of the end of October.

Refugees are not formally recognised in Malaysia, leaving them vulnerable to human traffickers, labour exploitation and extortion.

Children of refugees are also not allowed to attend government schools and are mostly educated by volunteers.

Transit point

Despite not recognising refugees, Malaysia has become a transit point for refugees, who are processed and transferred in third countries by agencies such as the UNHCR.

Last year Malaysia turned away boats carrying migrants including the Rohingya, but eventually took in 1,018 aboard a boat which tried to dock at Pulau Langkawi.

The boat was among several packed with economic migrants and refugees, who were left at sea by human traffickers following a crackdown in Thailand.

This followed the discovery of mass graves linked to human trafficking on the Thai-Malaysian border.

“If they want to go back, why would anyone stop them from going back?” he said.

On Feb 23, the Immigration Department had deported 1,086 Myanmar nationals despite the Kuala Lumpur High Court ordering the exercise to be on hold.

The lawsuit was filed by Amnesty International Malaysia and Asylum Access Malaysia over concerns that there are asylum seekers and minors with parents in Malaysia among the deportees.

This is in view of the ongoing violence in Myanmar following a military coup in February and persecution against the Rohingya community.

"KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 13 — Putrajaya needs to find a balance between immigration concerns and human rights to resolve issues related to refugees and those who are stateless in the country, the new chairman of the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (Suhakam) said in an interview. Speaking with news portal Malaysiakini, Prof Datuk Rahmat Mohamad suggested that proper documentation of the refugees and stateless people in the country would be the first step for them to access education, healthcare and hold legal jobs to contribute to the economy. According to the law expert, the core problem stems from Malaysia not ratifying the United Nations Refugee Convention. ""But I have this to say, even if we do not ratify the Refugee Convention, that does not mean the government cannot be benevolent. ""After all, these people have been here for how many years, so we are also guilty, we give them work but they do not have passports or documents. ""So, I think what needs to be done is to legalise and provide the necessary documentation. These are some of the things that are well within the jurisdiction and obligation of the state,” he was quoted saying in the interview published today. Rahmat said that he understands why the Immigration Department adopts a very strict stance against foreigners. ""The ones who have been here for years have not [had their issues resolved] and then there are still people coming,” he was quoted saying. He also reportedly said it is understandable why certain segments of Malaysians may view refugees and the stateless with xenophobia. ""We are basically a peace-loving country, but when people come to our country suddenly and invade our privacy, we’d also feel uncomfortable. ""It’s here where we have to find a formula. What is the best way to have the assurance that these people will work, and that is why the first thing we must do is to give education to these people so that they become more responsible,” he told the news portal. He indicated that education is the way forward to dealing with refugees so they would not have to resort to crime, which adds to negative perception of certain Malaysians towards them. ""I think we must be more positive, rather than looking at the negatives. ""After all, economically, it is good for the country because when these people work, they contribute [to the country]. ""[It is possible] with the proper documentation and scheme, the proper contributions, but all the parties must be willing to do it,” he was quoted saying. Rahmat sees Suhakam as being the intermediary to ease tension between Malaysians and refugees, such as by disseminating relevant data to raise public awareness on the matter. He said can help address concern among those Malaysians who fear the refugees are ""grabbing"" their jobs.

On April 16, the Royal Malaysian Navy prevented a boat carrying an estimated 200 Rohingya refugees from entering Malaysian waters near Langkawi.

A day before that, it was reported that at least two dozen people had died after a ship carrying 382 Rohingya refugees was repeatedly turned back by Malaysian authorities.

They were eventually rescued by the Bangladeshi coastguard, which said they had been adrift for two months.

Sevan noted concerns that the refugees may be infected with Covid-19 but said that can be addressed.

""They do not enjoy rights to work, receive a formal education, nor ready access to public healthcare services.

"PETALING JAYA: Malaysia’s road to providing basic care to migrants, undocumented persons and refugees seems to be littered with a lack of commitment, although their plight has constantly been raised in the media, claim social activists.

They are subjected to human rights abuses that include not having access to education and basic facilities such as a home, electricity and water.

The long-standing issue stems from the fact that Malaysia is not a party to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.

However, the government could introduce a localised law that defines asylum seekers, refugees and undocumented persons, said human rights lawyer Charles Hector.

“Having a specific Malaysian law that identifies and defines each status will be an extension of the Federal Constitution to provide care for everyone in Malaysia.

Meanwhile, humanitarian aid by non-governmental organisations acts as the lifeline to those living in such precarious conditions.

Social activist William Cheah from Kembara Kitchen said citizenship issues had been raised numerous times in the past.

“It is a large minefield issue on how to decide citizenship for them. This is because citizenship touches on economic challenges as well as social sentiments.

“There needs to be a political situation, rather than political will, to address their livelihood first,” he said.

"Govt urged to continue working with UNHCR on refugee care

THE new government must not withdraw recognition of United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) cards for asylum seekers and refugees, said activists.

They told The Malaysian Insight the stakeholders must be consulted in policy making for these groups.

They also want the Anwar Ibrahim government to continue working with the UNHCR instead of shutting down agency in Malaysia.

Adrian Pereira of North South Initiative urged Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail not to proceed with the plan to cancel the UNHCR card.

He said the last government’s plan for refugees would cost Malaysia more while making the target groups open to exploitation.

Pereira referred to the Tracking Refugees Information System (TRIS) introduced by the former home minister in July to store the data of UNHCR cardholders.

The system issues the cardholders with a new identification document called the MyRC.

Pereira said there were fears third parties would take advantage of the process to exploit the refugees.

“Refugees have to pay RM500 to get a card issued by the Malaysian government. However, the UNHCR card is issued to qualified refugee groups for free,” he said.

The new card is unnecessary because the Malaysian government should leave the job of determining the status of refugees to the UN, he said.

“The UNHCR’s job is to determine who is a refugee before issuing a refugee card,” he added.

In addition, he said, the new system could also be corrupted.

“Considering the history of corruption in our government system, we should avoid the process of issuing new refugee cards altogether,” Pereira said.

“Saifuddin should talk to refugee welfare groups before taking any new steps.”

He also urged the Malaysian government should sign the UN refugee convention and release all the refugees and asylum seekers who were locked up.

“Refugees and asylum seekers should not be in detention. Release them and give them appropriate assistance at once,” he added.

Activist Alex Ong of MigrantCARE said efforts to replace the UNHCR card with the TRIS system are a waste of time and money.

He said Malaysia needed better control over the illegal migration.

He said the TRIS refugee card is not recognised by other countries.

Refugee activist James Bawi said Malaysia should adhere to international norms when dealing with refugees.

He said the issue of a new refugee card should not have been a unilateral decision.

“The matter should have been debated in parliament and recognised through an act of law instead of being decided by a single ministry.

“The new government should retain the UNHCR issued card and establish better cooperation with the agency to improve the lives of refugees,” he said.

Hamzah has said in July that Malaysia did not need to recognise the UNHCR card and international protocols because it is not a member of the UN convention for refugees.

The TRIS card would ensure that only refugees identified by the government can stay in the country, he had said.

Hamzah had also proposed for the UNHCR to be closed down in Malaysia, saying the country could manage refugee issues on its own.

Suaram executive director Sevan Doraisamy said it is important for the new government to keep UNHCR in Malaysia.

“Refugees and their welfare, including their children’s education, are important issues that need immediate attention from the current government and it must work closely with UN bodies, including UNHCR, to address them,” he said.

“It is important to meet with the stakeholders immediately to discuss these and other alarming issues in relation to refugees in Malaysia.

"ALOR STAR: Twenty-seven male Rohingya refugees were spared the cane after the High Court here set aside the sentencing by the magistrate’s court.

The 27 accused were among 40 Rohingya refugees who were charged on June 18 for entering Malaysia illegally via Langkawi on March 18.

The 40 Rohingya were found guilty by the magistrate’s court in Langkawi for entering Malaysia without a valid travel document during the height of the movement control order in March; at the same time that Malaysia was enforcing a lockdown to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus.

They were all sentenced to seven months imprisonment for illegal entry while 27 of them were additionally given three strokes of the rotan.

They would later be released into the custody of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) upon serving their sentence.

Justice Dr Arik Sanusi Yeop Johari, in reviewing the earlier penalty, said the 27 persons were refugees in need of international protection due to the persecution they faced.

“In line with the international principle of non refoulement, they cannot be returned and in this regard, the court took judicial notice of the current situation in Rakhine, Myanmar,“ Arik Sanusi said.

The judge also ruled that the refugees were not habitual offenders, they did not commit any violence and therefore it is inhumane for them to be imposed with a sentence of whipping.

Furthermore, the refugees had also registered themselves with the UNHCR.

“The decision is laudable as it demonstrates the promotion and protection of human rights by the High Court,” said defense counsel Colin Andrew.

Under the Immigration Act, those who enter the country illegally are liable for a RM10,000 fine, up to five years imprisonment and six strokes of the rotan.

Before the court proceedings began here, several human rights organisations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, had pleaded for the refugees not to be caned.

Andrew also disclosed that six Rohingya teenagers, who were part of the 40 serving jail were be released immediately to the UNHCR.",,,"27 Rohingya nationals spared the cane, judge says refugees in need of protection",,0,1,0

Refugee groups say asylum seekers from the minority Chin, Kachin and non-Rohingya Muslim communities fleeing conflict and persecution at home are among those being deported.

"KUALA LUMPUR, June 18 ― Malaysia is considering a plan to send nearly 300 Rohingya Muslim refugees detained after arriving on a damaged boat back out to sea once the ship has been fixed, two security sources told Reuters today. Muslim-majority Malaysia has been a favoured destination for ethnic Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar and more recently, refugee camps in Bangladesh, in search of better prospects. But Malaysia has said it will no longer accept Rohingya refugees after tightening border controls to rein in the spread of the novel coronavirus. Malaysia had earlier asked Bangladesh to take back 269 Rohingya refugees, who were detained upon their arrival on June 8, but Bangladeshi officials had rejected the request. Authorities have now drawn up a plan to send the detainees back out to sea after the boat has been fixed, two Malaysian security sources said. They declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. “That is the current plan but no decision has been made yet,” one of the sources said. The boat would be supplied with food and water if the plan to push them out to sea was approved, the source said. The Malaysian government's National Taskforce on migrant issues, which includes the maritime agency, navy, police and immigration, did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Nor did Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin's office. The body of one Rohingya woman was found on the boat but rights groups say more had died while others were left starving after being stranded at sea for months before being rescued. The Arakan Project, a non-profit group focusing on the Rohingya crisis, urged Malaysia not to send the refugees back out to sea. “This would amount to refoulement and would be completely inhumane as passengers already died aboard this boat before it was rescued,” Chris Lewa, the group's director told Reuters. Refoulement means the forced return of refugees to a place where they risk persecution in contravention of international humanitarian and human rights laws. “Rohingya need protection and cannot be pushed off from one country to another, let alone back to sea.” In recent weeks, Malaysia has turned away at least two boats and detained hundreds of Rohingya already in the country, as well as other undocumented migrants. The action comes amid heightened public anger towards foreigners in Malaysia, who have been accused of spreading the coronavirus and being a burden on state resources. At least one boat with as many as 300 Rohingya refugees on board remains at sea, according to rights groups. Some of those on board are believed to be sick.

"Human rights NGO Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) has cried foul over the high number of children held at immigration detention centres.

It sought their release on human rights grounds as well as to reduce their risk of contracting Covid-19. Numerous immigration facilities have seen virus outbreaks due to their cramped conditions.

In a statement today, Lawyers for Liberty coordinator Zaid Malek pointed to the Home Ministry’s recent revelation that 756 foreign children were in detention as of Oct 26.

Of the number, 405 children were detained without their guardians, a bulk of them (326) from Myanmar.

ADS

Zaid deemed such detention as “inhumane” and questioned if any of the Myanmar children were Rohingya refugees.

“It is unfathomable as to why the authorities deem it fit and proper to detain hundreds of migrant and refugee children, most of whom are detained without guardians, in overcrowded detention centres during a worldwide health pandemic.

“The government is wilfully putting these vulnerable children at increased risk of Covid-19 infection... these children must not be treated as criminals, for they could not have entered the country on their own volition and are entirely victims of circumstance,” he said.

Since the pandemic began, immigration detention centres in Tawau, Alor Gajah, Bukit Jalil, Semenyih, Sepang and Putrajaya have experienced Covid-19 outbreaks.

By virtue of ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, Zaid said Malaysia had a duty to act in the best interests of children.

“We therefore strongly urge that the government immediately releases these children from detention into the care of their parents, guardians or the appropriate welfare authorities,” he said.

Zaid further called on the authorities to stop taking action on migrants during the Covid-19 pandemic and to release detained refugees.

"KUALA LUMPUR: The world's main pan-Islamic body is expected to pile pressure on Myanmar over a bloody crackdown on Rohingya Muslims when it meets for a special session in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday.

Nearly 70,000 Rohingya have fled the northern part of Rakhine state since October when the Myanmar army launched ""clearance operations"" to root out insurgents accused of deadly raids on police border posts.

Arriving in neighbouring Bangladesh, the displaced Rohingya have recounted allegations of widespread military abuse including rape, extrajudicial killings and the burning of villages.

The treatment of the Rohingya, a stateless group denied citizenship in Myanmar and reviled as illegal immigrants by the majority Buddhist population, has become a lightning rod for anger across the Muslim world.

Diplomats from the 56-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) will join Thursday's special session to debate the issue.

Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Abdul Razak has taken a lead role in condemning the Myanmar crackdown.

Analysts say that is at least in part down to a desire to burnish his international image after a damaging graft scandal at home.

On Wednesday Malaysia's Foreign Minister Anifa Aman upped the ante ahead of the meeting, calling for ""unimpeded access"" for humanitarian aid to reach the Rohingya.

He is expected to spearhead an effort within the OIC to raise cash and open aid routes into areas in western Rakhine state which remain locked-down.

""The OIC meeting is expected to call on the Myanmar government to help end the violence against the Rohingya Muslims,"" a Southeast Asian diplomat familiar told AFP.

""The OIC foreign ministers are also expected to provide assistance in cash or kind for the Rohingya.""

Buddhist-majority Myanmar refuses to recognise the Rohingya as one of the country's ethnic minorities.

Instead it describes them pejoratively as Bengalis – or illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh – even though many have lived in Myanmar for generations.

Suu Kyi criticised

The latest chapter of a crisis that has festered since riots broke out in Rakhine in 2012 has once more drawn in regional neighbours.

Bangladesh is struggling to cope with the fresh arrivals, while Malaysia has for years housed thousands of Rohingya refugees – many arrived during a 2015 exodus that saw boatloads of Rohingya stranded at sea.

The plight of the Rohingya has put Myanmar's democracy champion and de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi under immense international pressure.

She has been criticised for failing to speak up robustly in defence of the Rohingya, while analysts say the latest crackdown suggests she lacks leverage over Myanmar's still powerful military.

Premier Najib's intervention in the crisis has angered Myanmar which considers the violence in Rakhine state an internal matter.

""The amount is not a luxury. They have commitments to their family, and have to pay rent. How can they survive if they are not given job opportunities?"" he told theSun.

The Serdang MP said the “disturbing action” may make it harder for citizens of other predominantly Muslim countries such as Malaysia, to travel to, study in and work in the US. “Prime Minister Najib, on January 21, 2017 sent out a congratulatory message to Trump on his inauguration as the 45th President of the United States. “Will PM Najib also send a message to Trump to condemn this executive action that affects the citizens of these Muslim majority countries?” he asked in a statement, referring to Datuk Seri Najib Razak. Ong said many world leaders had criticised the order, signed on Friday, to suspend the US refugee resettlement programme for 120 days. The order also decreed all visa applications from seven Muslim countries ― Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen ― to be put on hold for at least 90 days. He said the order must be strongly condemned as it is an inhumane action especially for those Syrian refugees who have already been granted approval to travel to and seek asylum in the United States. “It is an unjustified action that affects thousands of students and employees who are studying and working legally in the United States,” Ong said.",,,Will Malaysia condemn Trump’s Muslim ban?

"KUALA LUMPUR: More than 40 Yemeni refugees gathered peacefully in front of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), here, on Wednesday to submit a memorandum demanding their rights.

The memorandum was submitted to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi by Yemeni activist Leena Al-Mujahed through the Deputy Representative of UNHCR Maja Lazic.

Al-Mujahed, who is also a refugee, said the group represents about 7,000 Yemeni refugees in Malaysia to obtain their rights including financial aid, health insurance, and job opportunities.

According to Al-Mujahed, the Yemeni refugees’ situation at this time is unsatisfactory because their basic rights as refugees are neglected and UNHCR has failed to play its role.

“Through today’s gathering, UNHCR Malaysia has informed us that a meeting will be held to discuss the issues raised by our community.

“We will wait, and we expect positive feedback from them as soon as possible,“ she told Bernama after the hour-long gathering and submission of the memorandum.

Al-Mujahed said the gist of the memorandum include the right to placement to a third country, basic educational and vocational rights, and health insurance rights and employment programmes for refugees.

According to the UNHCR website, a refugee has the right to safe asylum.

“Refugees should receive at least the same rights and basic help as any other foreigner who is a legal resident, including freedom of thought, of movement, and freedom from torture and degrading treatment.

“Economic and social rights are equally applicable. Refugees should have access to medical care, schooling and the right to work,“ added the statement on the website.

Meanwhile, the Yemeni Refugees’ community leader, Waleed Al-Fakih, said today’s rally was held to urge UNHCR to take a stand and strive to solve the Yemeni refugees’ problems in the country.

“We have been living in Malaysia for the past eight years and have only UNHCR cards without being granted refugee rights ... our application for relocation to third countries is also frozen.

“We are facing a difficult life without a permanent home and without work to support our family,“ he said.

As of the end of May this year, there are about 173,700 refugees and asylum seekers registered with UNHCR in Malaysia.

Of these, about 93,000 are ethnic Rohingya, 24,000 (China), 9,700 (Myanmar Muslims), 4,000 (Rakhine & Arakan) and 23,300 from countries like Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Iraq, Palestine and Syria. — Bernama",,,Yemeni refugee group conveys memorandum to UNHCR,,0,1,0
"COX’S BAZAR (Bangladesh), Oct 17 — Malaysia will assign a humanitarian and welfare attache to Bangladesh to fulfil the government’s commitment in helping Rohingya ethnic refugees currently sheltered at refugee camps in Bangladesh. Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said he would raise the matter in the Cabinet next week to expedite the process. “The attache, from the National Security Council (MKN) will be based at the Malaysian High Commission in Dhaka. He will assist the high commission’s office not only to coordinate but also ensure that every aid reaches the refugees,” he told Malaysian journalists here, at the end of his two-day working visit to Bangladesh since Sunday. While visiting the Rohingya refugee camp in Kutupalong, about 35 km from here on Monday, Ahmad Zahid said the MKN would coordinate the process of channelling humanitarian aid to the recipients. “This is to ensure that all aid reach the target in addition to ensuring the type of assistance that the refugees need,” he said. He is confident that with Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak’s commitment, the Foreign Affairs Ministry would be able to initiate the administrative appointment immediately, in a matter of 30 days. “This move will hopefully reflect the government’s commitment in easing the plight of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. This is the first time that we are assigning a humanitarian and welfare attache,” he said. He added that although there had never been any occasion where aid did not reach the recipients, it was still good to conduct constant monitoring. Meanwhile, he would discuss with the prime minister and propose to the cabinet on MKN’s role as coordinator in channelling aid to the Rohingya refugees. “It includes aid from the government to set up a field hospital, which would be built by the Defence Ministry, Health Ministry and Malaysian Armed Forces Medical Corps. “As well as cooperation with the media to collect aid for MKN to channel to Malaysian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Bangladesh and other welfare bodies concerned with the Rohingya people,” he said. He also expressed his appreciation to Malaysian NGOs that are in Bangladesh to render aid to the Rohingya refugees. Prior to the press conference, Ahmad Zahid presented six million taka (RM309,000) to the Malaysian Consultative Council for Islamic Organisations (Mapim) and two million taka (RM103,000) to Mercy Malaysia in regard to their efforts to assist Rohingya refugees. The humanitarian crisis in the Rakhine, Myanmar is worsening with more ethnic Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh daily and more refugee camps being set up. The exact number of refugees is unknown but estimated by many quarters as having exceeded one million. For the record, there are only two official camps for the Rohingya refugees, namely Kutupalong and Nayapara but dozens more have been set up by the refugees with the number increasing by the day. — Bernama",,,DPM: Humanitarian attache to be assigned to Bangladesh,,0,1,0
"ISTANBUL: Berjaya group founder Tan Sri Vincent Tan scored big time in his bid to assist Syrian refugees in Turkey, after a fruitful meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday.

Speaking to the press after visiting the president, Tan revealed that Erdogan has agreed to provide a piece of land to the Tzu Chi Foundation of which he is a volunteer, for the purpose of building a new school for the refugees.

In addition, the president also agreed to provide Advanced Continuing Education (ACE) certificates to up to 3,000 refugee students each year.

This is an increase from the current quota of only 531, which will allow their examination results to be recognised in other countries when furthering their studies.

Currently, some 3,000 Syrian children are pursuing their education at the El Menahil International School, which is deemed by the Turkish government to be over-populated.

Tan, who was ostensibly upbeat and cheerful during the press conference, described the hour-long meeting with Erdogan as “very positive”, saying the president is extremely supportive of Tzu Chi’s plans and works.

“We came here to help Tzu Chi in their bid to assist the refugees, and I think we have achieved much more than we initially expected, especially after we managed to pay a courtesy call on the president.

“Because Tzu Chi did not have access or direct contact with the government, I used whatever contacts I have to meet Erdogan,” he said.

Tan added he is also looking at possibly investing in the tourism sector in Istanbul, and is considering developing a hotel here.

Present at the meeting with the president were, among others, Turkish Ambassador to Malaysia Merve Kavakci, Top Glove Corporation Bhd executive chairman Tan Sri Dr Lim Wee Chai, Berjaya Times Square chief operating officer Morvin Tan, as well as Faisal Hu and wife Nadia Chou, -- a couple who leads Tzu Chi’s Istanbul chapter.

Faisal said Erdogan has agreed to arrange further meetings between his office and Tzu Chi on the proposal to allocate a land for the new school and the plan to register the students under ACE.

He said although it would take some time to build a new school, it is a “dream come true” for Tzu Chi and the students in particular.

The current school (El Menahil International School) was set up by the Sultangazi government, Syrian teachers and Tzu Chi in 2015 and provides classes for all levels of primary, elementary and secondary.

Meanwhile, Lim said Erdogan would consider allowing Top Glove, to build a glove factory in Turkey, that would subsequently provide job opportunities to between 500 and 1,000 individuals.

“We even suggested that maybe a portion of this job openings be provided to the Syrian refugees. And he is very receptive of this proposal,” Lim said.

Tan and Lim are currently on a special three-day mission to Syria, along with 25 Malaysian Tzu Chi volunteers, to provide financial assistance and other aid to the refugees here.",,,Vincent Tan gets Erdogan to help refugees,,0,0,0
"BANGKOK: Malaysia wants a comprehensive plan on the deportation of ethnic Rohingya refugees to ensure their safety, according to Foreign Minister Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah today.

He said Malaysia is committed to helping the Rohingya refugees and is focused on three matters at the 34th Asean Summit here.

“At a dinner attended by Asean foreign ministers yesterday, Malaysia expressed its opinion on the need for the views of the ethnic Rohingya, as well as that of the Civil Society Organisation (CSO) which is doing humanitarian work at Cox’s Bazaar, be sought before the repatriation of the refugees,” he told the Malaysian media after attending the Asean Foreign Minister’s Meeting (AMM), here today.

He said Malaysia wants justice for the ethnic Rohingya and to bring to justice irresponsible parties who violated their rights.

Malaysia is also committed to improving its humanitarian work at Cox’s Bazaar and also the well-being of the ethnic Rohingya refugees in its country, he added.

On the 24-hour operation at the Bukit Kayu Hitam Immigration, Customs, Quarantine and Security Complex and the Sadao CIQ since last June 18, Saifuddin said it was well-received by the public, but there were several issues that needed to be addressed, especially congestion at the Sadao CIQ. - Bernama",,,Malaysia wants more comprehensive plan on deportation of Rohingya refugees,,0,0,0

"MP SPEAKS | Under Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals, the right to adequate food is a universal human right that is realised when all people have physical and economic access at all times to adequate food or the means for its procurement, without discrimination of any kind.

Shockingly, Selayang Baru in Gombak is now suddenly placed as the seventh lockdown area under an enhanced movement control order (MCO). This adds to the growing fear that people can suddenly find themselves placed under severe restrictions without enough supplies.

ADS

Unfortunately, this has been implemented by invoking Section 18 of the National Security Council (NSC) Act, granting the council-wide and unfettered powers to declare a ""state of emergency"" in a designated area (also known as security area).

However, to suddenly declare lockdown areas and yet fail to ensure the continued supply of food, as seen in parts of Selayang after it was placed under the enhanced MCO, shows the lack of preparedness of the government to guarantee food security.

Recently I received two requests for aid from residents in Selayang who are in desperate need of food supplies. Residents there are placed under a stressful situation as they are not allowed to leave their homes to buy food and shops were closed without due notice. Many were caught unprepared and do not have enough supplies to last them even for a few days.

ADS

Despite the government’s promise that food will be sent to the area, food delivery was not carried out within 24 hours, leaving many people yet to receive anything.

While I understand the need to act quickly and decisively to isolate particular areas to contain the spread of Covid-19, we must not forget people’s access to food and that they are living in fear because of a lack of information and coordination to guarantee their survival during the enhanced MCO.

There is an urgent need for the government to work together with all parties including NGOs, private sector and elected representatives from all divides to guarantee food access in the designated enhanced MCO areas and also to the vulnerable communities especially the B40 nationwide.

ADS

This enhanced MCO has also brought up several disturbing issues relating to food distribution.

Centralised control over food distribution

The vision of “Shared Prosperity” is seriously tested when aid becomes politicised and food distribution is highly controlled by the government.

It was announced that food baskets will be distributed to each parliamentary constituency for the needy. However, on the ground, it was alleged that the government, through the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development, was selective over where the aid was being distributed.

Many Opposition MPs, including myself, hardly received sufficient quantities of essential food items to be distributed to the needy.

The present government had allegedly cut off all Opposition MPs’ development funds when it came into power. I had to seek my own funding to buy food for the vulnerable in my constituency. I am lucky because many generous Malaysians contributed funds and donations in-kind to help those in need in Petaling Jaya.

However, many of the other Opposition MPs, despite having given out food supplies to many themselves, are struggling to cope with the growing requests for food, especially from enhanced MCO lockdown areas.

Lack of transparency on food distribution

Where have all the food baskets gone to? Cheras MP Tan Kok Wai stumbled upon loads of food baskets that were not distributed but stored for more than a week (below).

Recently, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob denied claims that the value of the government food baskets only came up to RM35, saying that these baskets were from the civil society. Yet, at the same time, he failed to disclose the value of the government’s food baskets, how many were allocated per constituency and to whom they have been given?

Not reaching the deserving poor and marginalised

If the database on who is poor and where they are is available, it would have allowed aid to reach them faster. As civil society, parliamentarians and state assembly representatives struggle to get food on the table for the poor, it is also a stressful process to locate, verify and finally distribute the food.

On many occasions, I stumbled upon people who fell out of the “database” like an elderly woman who depended on her brother who lost his job because of the enhanced MCO, a daily wage-earning single mother who cannot go out to earn money to buy diapers for her paralysed son because of the lockdown, a single mother of seven who struggled to feed her family, and many more.

It also brings up the fact that women suffer the most if they are the single female heads of households.

Migrant workers, refugees and marginalised communities are finding it hard to get food when they are daily wage earners or when employers must stop work due to the enhanced MCO.

I have encountered four migrant workers sharing a single packet of instant noodle a day, while another 200 Bangladesh migrant workers were left to share 100 packets of take-aways between themselves.

I urge the government to take food security and the right to have access to food more seriously and implement the following suggestions:

(i) Decentralise and democratise the distribution of food to allow the Welfare Department to work with parliamentarians, civil society as well as other government agencies to get food quicker to the needy.

(ii) Have an effective, transparent and accessible database so that marginalised communities and the most vulnerable people including the elderly, the disabled and migrant workers do not get left out from receiving aid. This information should be shared right down to the humanitarian groups working on the ground to reduce the possibility of people being left out.

(iii) Utilise the latest technologies such as Big Data, 5G and AI to better coordinate supply chains within industries to help with the manufacturing and production of food, medical supplies and other essential items during the MCO. Build a sustainable domestic food supply in the long run.

(iv) Form a cross-party emergency council made up of professionals and experts in healthcare, social services, investments, banking and food security to build a road map for the implementation of key policies during and post-Covid 19 so that we are better prepared and coordinated for the future.

(v) Activate the Parliament Select Committees to be part of the cross-party emergency council to develop a strategic plan post-Covid-19. The aim is to plan not just for economic recovery and sustainability but to build a more resilient social safety net for all.

Sadly, at times like these, there are Malaysians who are starving and being made to live like in an active warzone without any knowledge of when their situation might change.

For the immediate and in the long term, strategic planning has to start now, otherwise, Malaysia will suffer.

"KUALA LUMPUR: Syrian refugee, Hassan al Kontar will get a new lease of life in Canada after living in Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (klia2) for six months.

Hassan who landed in Canada at 10.30am today has been granted permanent resident status under Canada’s “Private Sponsorship of Refugees” (PSR) program, said his lawyer Datuk Seri M. Ramachelvan.

The Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program is a Canadian initiative established in 1978 under Operation Lifeline, whereby refugees can resettle in Canada with support and funding from private or joint government-private sponsorship.

Al Kontar’s Canadian legal representative Andrew Brouwer could not be reached for comments.

Al Kontar had on Monday posted a video on Twitter from the Taiwan International Airport that he was on his way to Vancouver, Canada.

“For now, it’s not important where I have been or what went on ... What is important is today and tomorrow. The present and the future,“ he said on Twitter.

“I could not do it without the support and prayers from all of you. I could not do it without the help of my family, my Canadian friend’s family, my lawyer. Thank you all,“ he added.

Al-Kontar was arrested at the klia2 almost seven months after being stranded when officials refused to let him board a flight to Ecuador, on March 7.

The 36-year-old was left stranded in the terminal, surviving on donated airline meals and washing up in the toilets.

Al-Kontar, reportedly sought by authorities in his homeland for failing to serve in the military, was also refused entry into Cambodia and not allowed back into Malaysia due to visa issues.",,,"Syrian refugee Hassan lands in Canada, granted PR",,0,0,0

"PETALING JAYA, Jan 22 — British broadcaster the BBC has come under fire for the reported mistreatment of Rohingya refugees who were hired as extras for a popular TV series that is currently being filmed in Malaysia. The military drama called Our Girl follows the adventures of female medics in the British Army. It is understood that the controversial scenes were filmed for the show’s fourth series, which is slated to air in the United Kingdom in April. UK’s The Sun reported sources as claiming the show’s producers hired about 100 Rohingya refugees as extras for just £33 (RM180) a day. Sources also told the tabloid that the refugees were “forced to relive their nightmares” when they were asked to participate in “horrific scenes.” The allegations included being asked to dig “graves” in a real rubbish dump as well as extras collapsing from heat exhaustion after being made to work 12 hours a day. It was also claimed that the extras were “sprayed with an industrial gun to make them look filthy” before they were asked to wade through a river with “terrified babies and children in their arms”. An extra named as Habibah Abdullah who spent 15 days at sea after fleeing Myanmar recounted her on-set experience with her two-year-old daughter to The Sun. Habibah who cannot swim was quoted as saying: “We were in fast-moving water and I was terrified. It took hours to do the scenes and we had to go into the water again and again. “Babies were crying and children all around me were screaming ‘Mummy, mummy.’” Meanwhile, another extra Mubarak Bindi who fled Myanmar after her village was razed to the ground said filming scenes in a replica of a refugee camp brought back “terrible feelings”. “My heart sank when I saw the film set. It reminded me of where I had to live after my village was burned down. “It brought back all the terrible feelings of that time. I felt very upset,” she was quoted as saying by The Sun. Sources told The Sun tabloid that many of the show’s cast and crew were “furious” with the treatment of the “vulnerable” refugees on the set, including its star Michelle Keegan. In a statement to The Sun, a spokesman for the BBC refuted the allegations and said the refugees were paid the standard local rate. The rep for the British broadcaster added that the Our Girl storyline was conceived to shed a light on the plight of the Rohingya. “All the supporting artists were contracted in the normal manner and at rates standard for work in Malaysia, including some Rohingya refugees living in Malaysia. “At no point were any of the artists asked to do anything that would compromise their safety and their welfare was of paramount importance to us,” the spokesman said. The spokesman also addressed the case of the Rohingya extra who collapsed from heat exhaustion, saying that he was attended to by an on-set medic and taken to hospital with a producer. “Filming stopped to allow this to happen and there is no footage of the event in the programme,” he added. Since August 2017, nearly 650,000 Rohingya have fled a military operation in Myanmar’s westernmost Rakhine state described by the UN and US as “ethnic cleansing”. Statistics provided by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees last November showed that there are currently more than 60,000 Rohingya refugees in Malaysia.",,,BBC drama filmed in Malaysia slammed for exploiting Rohingya refugees hired as extras,,0,0,0

"KUALA LUMPUR: A 25-year-old Iraqi man was held on Sunday night in connection with the murder of an African woman who was found dead by a road shoulder on Jalan Memanda 2, near Ampang Point about 12 hour earlier.

Ampang Jaya police chief ACP Mohamad Farouk Eshak said the Iraqi who has refugee status under the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was arrested at Ampang Putra near Ampang Jaya here at 11.20pm.

He said a knife believed to be the murder weapon was also recovered.

Mohamad Farouk said the suspect and the 28-year-old victim were colleagues and worked at an Arab restaurant.

He said investigations are ongoing to ascertain what had led to the suspect and victim to be embroiled in a fight which led to the death of the latter.

Mohamad Farouk said police learnt that the African woman had come to Malaysia with her family about nine years ago.

“We managed to solve the case within a day with the arrest of the Iraqi. The suspect is in our custody for the murder investigation under a seven-day remand order,“ he said.

Mohamad Farouk said a post mortem on the victim’s body is ongoing at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital but an initial report revealed that tests showed the woman was positive for Covid-19.

Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said 97 percent of the 6,000 affected were migrants.

""I have said it clearly before, migrants in our country are the responsibility of their respective embassies (and high commissions),"" he told a press conference in Putrajaya today.

Currently, the government provides Malaysians under the enhanced movement control order (MCO) with essentials.

According to Ismail, migrants under the enhanced MCO can also purchase essentials by placing orders at the operations centre enforcing the lockdown.

"KUALA LUMPUR, March 24 — Malaysia decided today to postpone planned deportations to Myanmar until after a proposed emergency regional summit to discuss the crisis there brought on by a military coup, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Right groups raised concerns over the safety of deportees when Malaysia sent back 1,086 Myanmar nationals on Myanmar navy ships last month, just weeks after the military had seized power in a February 1 coup. Detained in Malaysia for immigration offences, they were deported despite a court order halting the plan. Rights groups had told the court that children and asylum-seekers fleeing persecution in Myanmar were among those being deported. Three Malaysian sources familiar with the matter said the decision to delay a plan to deport a second batch until after a proposed meeting of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) to discuss the Myanmar crisis was taken at a cabinet meeting today. The sources requested anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media. Myanmar this month had offered to send three more navy ships to pick up its people detained in Malaysia, one of the sources said. Malaysia’s foreign ministry directed queries to the home affairs ministry and immigration department, neither of which responded to requests for comment. Indonesia last week called on Brunei, the current chair of Asean, to convene an urgent meeting to discuss the situation in Myanmar, amid a violent crackdown on anti-coup protesters. Malaysia backed Indonesia’s call, but it is unclear whether, or when, that meeting would be held. Malaysia came under international pressure after sending back the Myanmar nationals last month, with diplomats saying Kuala Lumpur was legitimising the coup by accepting the junta’s proposal to take back the detainees. Malaysia said the people deported last month were undocumented migrants and did not include ethnic Rohingya refugees or asylum-seekers. But concerns have persisted as the UN refugee agency has been denied access to detainees for more than a year to verify their status. — Reuters",,,"Malaysia puts deportations to Myanmar on hold till after Asean meets, say sources",,0,0,0
"PETALING JAYA: Vaccine-preventable diseases can be controlled if vaccinations are done proactively regardless of a child’s nationality, a paediatrician pointed out yesterday.

Datuk Dr Amar Singh, a senior consultant paediatrician, said polio made a comeback in the country after 12 years because refugees, undocumented children, immigrants and stateless children were not all immunised.

“The real problem in Sabah lies in the fact that we don’t vaccinate these quarters, or rather they are charged money ... if I am not mistaken, RM40 per vaccination,” he said.

“If you are stateless or someone from that category, you won’t have the means to pay that amount of money. That is the problem. If you don’t vaccinate other children, we will harm our own children.

“This is because we create an environment where a sizeable number of stateless and immigrant children are not immunised.”

Amar said the Health Ministry had announced that it would work with other agencies and obtain funds from the Philippines.

“But no, I think we should invest our own money because this is an investment for our own children,” he added.

Similarly, another physician suggested several “stepwise approaches” to provide essential healthcare to non-citizens in Malaysia.

In conjunction with International Human Rights Day, Suhakam chairman Tan Sri Razali Ismail raised several pertinent matters related to the state of human rights in the country and said that monitoring the election will be one of its roles to fulfil people’s rights. “Suhakam will be monitoring closely how it (the elections) will be conducted on the premise that democracy must exist with election integrity,” he said in a statement. Razali added that there were many aspects and challenges to human rights which Putrajaya has yet to address.

Nevertheless, Razali said Suhakam will continue to encourage the government to broaden the search for solutions to address these issues. “The ultimate solution is to address and ameliorate drivers of displacement for such as conflict, breakdown of the rule of law, weak governance and the failure of legal institutions,” he added.

"Umno vice-president Khaled Nordin today opined that Malaysia must improve in its treatment of refugees.

He said refugees should be allowed to register with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and be given freedoms, including the freedom to work.

""This will allow them to develop skills, sustain themselves and reduce the burden on the government,"" he said in a statement today.

Political opinions on the better treatment of refugees are rare among Umno leaders.

Successive BN governments had never ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention. The only Asean country that is a signatory is the Philippines.

As such, under Malaysian law, refugees have neither legal recognition nor UNHCR-issue identification cards, which can help refugees resettle in other countries.

Malaysia's treatment of refugees has come under the spotlight once again following the escape of 528 undocumented persons from a detention centre in Kedah.

Six people - including women and children - died while escaping.

According to Home Minister Hamzah Zainudin, all the detainees were from the Rohingya ethnic group and had been in detention since 2020.

Khaled said unrest at immigration detention centres is not new, suggesting that it had likely to do with the conditions and the long duration of detention.

"Lack of access to mental health professionals is a major issue for refugees, said the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office in Malaysia.

In a statement to Malaysiakini following Tuesday's murder-suicide involving a refugee family in Kepong, Kuala Lumpur, the humanitarian agency said the problem was usually due to financial constraints and lack of awareness.

“Refugees who have gone through forced displacement often face psychological stress from experiences in countries of origin, transit country, and in the country of asylum.

“Maintaining mental health is crucial to the overall wellbeing of individuals. In refugee settings, lack of access to mental health professionals is often a major issue, due to financial constraints and lack of awareness.

ADS

“It is also compounded by the lack of specialised expertise in the country dealing with the mental health needs of refugees that arise from their unique circumstances,” said spokesperson Yante Ismail.

Malaysiakini contacted UNHCR Malaysia for comments on the incident early Tuesday morning, which saw two Myanmar children killed while another sibling was seriously injured after they were thrown from a flyover by their father, who then plunged to his death from the same spot.

It was later revealed that the father, 38, had been suffering from depression for about a year after he was unable to find employment and was infected with Covid-19.

Factors contributing to suicide are often complex, and mental health problems do not necessarily lead to suicide.

Although a serious public health problem, suicides are preventable with timely, evidence-based, and often low-cost interventions, according to the World Health Organization.

Yante said refugees in Malaysia can access mental health and psychosocial support services that are provided by UNHCR NGO partners here.

They include the Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation, Health Equity Initiatives, Acts, Humankind, and the QFFD Clinic run by Mercy Malaysia.

Those who wish to engage in the services can find their contact information via UNHCR’s RefugeeMalaysia.org information portal or by clicking here.

According to Yante, UNHCR also has an online psychosocial support group project with the University of New South Wales (UNSW) for refugee women.

"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia is committed to assist the 56,000 Rohingya refugees currently residing in the country by absorbing them into the semi-skilled workforce.

Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said such effort would allow ethnic Rohingyas with UNHCR cards to become an asset to the nation, rather than becoming a liability.

Ahmad Zahid, who is also the Home Minister, said the government is currently in the midst of scrutinising the plan to allow for Rohingya refugees to be able to work legally in Malaysia.

""They will be given training in the semi-skill sector and we will scrutinise the implementation to provide them with work opportunity.

"TEKNAF (Bangladesh), May 31 — Bangladesh coast guards yesterday stopped 58 Rohingya refugees from making a potentially dangerous journey to Malaysia by sea and arrested two suspected traffickers, an official said. Acting on a tip-off, a patrol ship challenged a fishing boat near Saint Martin’s, a small Bangladesh island in the Bay of Bengal, and found the Rohingya on board, coast guard Lieutenant Josel Rana said. “We’ve found 58 refugees and detained two human traffickers on the boat,” he told AFP. About 740,000 Muslim minority Rohingya have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh since a brutal military crackdown in the Buddhist-majority nation began in August 2017. Thousands of refugees attempt to flee the camps each year in pursuit of better opportunities in countries such as Malaysia and Thailand. So far this year, law enforcement agencies in Bangladesh have rescued over 400 Rohingya refugees from coastal villages as they were waiting to board boats bound for Malaysia. But this is the first time in 2019 that Rohingya refugees were rescued at sea, raising concerns that the situation in Bangladesh’s overcrowded camps — home to nearly one million — is worsening. “Such incidents will continue as desperation among the refugees is on the rise,” said Emdadul Haq, a professor at the private North South University in Dhaka. Rana said most of the refugees picked up by the coast guard were from the Kutupalong camp — the largest refugee settlement in the world. Most attempt the journey before March, when the sea is calm before the monsoon season sets in, but experts say traffickers are now convincing the refugees to attempt the trip even in rough waters. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has said the vulnerability of Rohingya to trafficking has increased enormously as livelihoods, support networks, and other fundamental systems are disrupted. — AFP",,,Bangladesh picks up 58 Malaysia-bound Rohingya at sea,,0,0,1

A day before that, it was reported that at least two dozen people had died after a ship carrying 382 Rohingya refugees was repeatedly turned back by Malaysian authorities.

They were eventually rescued by the Bangladeshi coastguard, which said they had been adrift for two months.

Refugees are not formally recognised in Malaysia, leaving them vulnerable to human traffickers, labour exploitation and extortion.

Despite not recognising refugees, Malaysia has become a transit point for refugees, who are processed and transferred in third countries by agencies such as the UNHCR.

Last year Malaysia turned away boats carrying migrants including the Rohingya, but eventually took in 1,018 aboard a boat which tried to dock at Pulau Langkawi.

The boat was among several packed with economic migrants and refugees, who were left at sea by human traffickers following a crackdown in Thailand.

This followed the discovery of mass graves linked to human trafficking on the Thai-Malaysian border.

Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng launched the campaign both on the island and mainland sides with a clarion call to the young and the able to help those aggrieved by the floods to get back on their feet.

He said that there were many obstacles in the way due to the sheer after effects of the floods; from debris and mud leftovers to stalled cars and fallen trees besides the financial losses incurred by the victims.

Last weekend's floods inundated 80% of Penang, and caused at one time up to 9,000 people to be resettled in some 400 flood relief centres.

But with generally good weather over the last seven days, there is a sense of normalcy returning to Penang although there is a weather forecast predicting thunderstorms in many parts of the country.

"DHAKA, July 9 — Hundreds of Rohingya refugees on a flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal will not be allowed to leave unless they agree to return home, Bangladesh authorities said today. The 306 Muslim Rohingya from Myanmar were put on Bhashan Char island in April after being taken off two boats trying to traffic them to Malaysia. Their plight has been taken up by the United Nations, an international rights group and community leaders, who want them moved to more established refugee camps on the mainland. “They will stay at Bhasan Char until they are repatriated to Myanmar,” Mohammed Khorshed Alam Khan, administrator for the district covering the island, told AFP. He said the refugees are well taken care of and have better facilities than in the overcrowded camps in Cox’s Bazar where 700,000 Rohingya fled in 2017 to escape a Myanmar military clampdown. In April, Bangladesh authorities said the Rohingya would be kept on the island in order to stop the spread of coronavirus in the sprawling refugee camps. But Human Rights Watch (HRW) questioned that motivation, and said the refugees were not being treated well. “Bangladesh authorities are using the pandemic as an excuse to detain refugees on a spit of land in the middle of a churning monsoon sea while their families anxiously pray for their return,” said Brad Adams, the organisation’s Asia representative. He also asked why Bangladesh authorities were not giving aid workers access to the island settlement. A Rohingya leader from the Cox’s Bazar camps said relatives of those on the island wanted to hold talks with Bangladesh’s refugee commissioner. “We request the authorities to send our children to our families,” said Mohib Ullah, head of the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights, which lobbies for the Rohingya.

"YANGON: Scores of Rohingya refugees leaving Bangladeshi camps by boat have accidentally returned to the crisis-hit area of Myanmar they originally fled from, after their vessel broke up on the sea route south.

Around one million Rohingya have fled Myanmar army crackdowns since 2016 for Bangladesh, where they live in cramped, flood-prone camps now being battered by the seasonal monsoon.

On Monday morning a boat carrying 104 Bangladeshis and Rohingya ran into trouble off the coast of Rakhine state, a Myanmar government spokesman told AFP, eventually breaking apart and forcing the passengers to head for shore.

The vessel was believed to be relatively close to the coast, enabling the refugees to survive.

For some it is likely to be an unexpected and unwelcome return to a state they were forced to run from, carrying accounts of atrocities by Myanmar's army and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists.

""These Muslim people were going from Bangladesh to Malaysia by the boat owned by a Malaysian man,"" spokesman Zaw Htay told AFP on Wednesday.

""Some are Bangladesh citizens, the majority are from the camps... people from Bangladesh who fled,"" he said.

Myanmar denies the Rohingya citizenship and officials do not recognise the term, instead labelling them ""Bengalis"", shorthand for illegal infiltrators from the neighbouring country.

They were taken to Nga Khu Ya camp in Rakhine's Muangdaw district - a purpose-built facility meant to process refugees returning under a discredited repatriation deal with Bangladesh.

Photographs showed the passengers — including women and young children — walking barefoot into Myanmar police trucks with virtually no possessions and drenched under heavy rains.

Passengers had paid people smugglers around US$235 to ferry them to Malaysia with the promise of another US$2,100 once they were able to find work in the Muslim-majority country, Zaw Htay added.

Tens of thousands of Rohingya and Bangladeshi economic migrants are believed to have died at sea in recent years trying to reach Malaysia.

The well worn trafficking route collapsed in 2015, when shallow graves were found at migrant holding camps across the Thai-Malaysian borders.

But boats still make the journey south.

"The Foreign Ministry is emphasising on the educational aspect to help find a solution to the Rohingya refugees issue in the country, Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said.

“Education is very important to prevent them from getting involved in social problems or crime here, besides making it easier for them to be selected by a third country,” he said at a press conference after delivering the ministry's 2022 New Year’s message in Putrajaya yesterday.

Most of them do not intend to settle in Malaysia, Saifuddin said.

“They make Malaysia a stopover and expect to be accepted by third countries, but third countries are also choosy and one of the selection criteria is that they have some education,” he said.

Saifuddin said Wisma Putra was looking at ways to empower and increase funding for refugee schools run by NGOs to ensure that Rohingya refugee children in the country were not dropped out of the education system.

“The funds are not from the people or the government but are funds that can be sought from external sources. For example, among the many sources are the funding from the Qatar Foundation,” he said.

Besides, he said, the issue of Rohingya refugees in the country needs to be addressed comprehensively and collectively by the relevant agencies and ministries.

Wisma Putra always holds discussions with the Home Ministry and the Education Ministry as well as other agencies involving the Rohingya issue in the country.

“I would like to remind that Malaysia is not a signatory to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) but we play a role as if we are a signatory,” he said.

The issue of Rohingya refugees was once again raised recently after a video clip of a Rohingya child scolding people for not giving alms to him spread on social media.

Earlier, a Rohingya refugee Abd Hamim Ab Hamid, 33, known as Long Tiger, was reported to have escaped from the Tangkak Magistrate's Court lock-up on Dec 15. The man was later arrested on Dec 28.

"KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 30 — The Foreign Ministry is monitoring the rising number of Malaysians who applied for permanent protection and refugee visas from the Australian government. In a statement today, the ministry found the number was significant as Malaysians were taking advantage of the opportunity by manipulating Australian Immigration laws to enable them to reside longer illegally. The statement also said the move had resulted in difficulties for bona fide parties who wished to study, visit and reside in Australia. Therefore, the Malaysian Foreign Ministry and the Immigration Department will continue to cooperate with the authorities in Australia to monitor the issue. “The Foreign Minister reminded Malaysians visiting any countries to adhere to the regulations and laws of the country concerned to avoid getting into trouble,” the statement said.

"LHOKSEUMAWE, Sept 7 — Almost 300 Rohingya refugees believed to have been at sea for six months landed in Indonesia’s Aceh province early today, Indonesian authorities have confirmed. Acehnese police said a wooden boat carrying the Rohingya was spotted by local fishermen several kilometres off the coast of Lhokseumawe, before landing at Ujung Blang Beach just after midnight “There are 297 Rohingya according to the latest data, among them 181 women and 14 children,” Iptu Irwansya, a local police chief, told Reuters. Junaidi Yahya, head of the Red Cross in Lhokseumawe, said the group was currently being held in a temporary location. “We hope they can be moved to the evacuation centre today, but their health, especially related to Covid-19, is our main concern,” said Yahya. Among the group was one sick 13-year-old who police said was taken to hospital in an ambulance. Images of the Rohingya arrivals show lines of women in masks carrying their possessions in plastic bags, and men huddled on the floor of a thatched roof shelter. Today’s arrival follows the arrival of another vessel in late June when Acehnese fishermen rescued more than 100 Rohingya refugees, including 79 women and children, after Indonesian authorities had initially threatened to push them back. Fleeing persecution in Myanmar and refugee camps in Bangladesh, the Rohingya have for years boarded boats in an attempt to seek refuge in other Southeast Asian nations. Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project, a non-profit group focusing on the Rohingya crisis, said the passengers that arrived in Aceh today had set sail from southern Bangladesh at the end of March or early April, bound for Malaysia. But both Malaysian and Thai authorities pushed them back, she said, as borders tightened due to coronavirus pandemic. Smugglers split the passengers into several boats, some of which managed to land in Malaysia and Indonesia in June, but several hundred remained at sea until Sunday night. The smugglers called their families to demand payments in the weeks before they were taken to shore, she said. “The smugglers seemed to not want to try to disembark them because not everyone had paid… They were basically keeping them hostage on the boat,” she said. — Reuters",,,Almost 300 Rohingya refugees initially bound for Malaysia arrive in Aceh,,0,0,0
"A retired army personnel has been linked to a condemning statement about the Rohingya refugees in Malaysia.

Mohd Radzi Abdul Hamid's purported official statement on the Rohingya entitled ""Siapakah Rohingya?"" (Who are the Rohingya?) has circulated on social media and shared by thousands of netizens.

"Refugees in Malaysia are in fear of being deported to face persecution in their war-torn countries.

Alliance of Chin Refugees chairperson James Bawi Thang Bik said that the fear arises as some of the refugees and asylum seekers who hold United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) cards, were arrested and lumped together with undocumented migrants.

They were hauled in during operations by immigration authorities in tandem with the movement control order (MCO) since March this year, and according to James, they were treated the same as undocumented migrants.

Based on figures by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), there are about 178,450 UNHCR refugees and asylum-seekers in Malaysia. More than half of the figure includes Rohingyas, while there are 22,440 Chins in the country.

Charles stressed that the government contradicted itself when it welcomed Rohingyas to seek refuge in the country but they are now labelled as ""illegal.""

""They are not here to steal our land. If you ask them about their dream, it's to go back to their country once it achieves peace. They are here temporarily before moving out to a third country,"" he said.

"As coronavirus infections surged in Malaysia this year, a wave of hate speech and misinformation aimed at Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar began appearing on Facebook.

Alarmed rights groups reported the material to Facebook.

But six months later, many posts targeting the Rohingya in Malaysia remain on the platform, including pages such as ""Anti Rohingya Club"" and ""Foreigners Mar Malaysia's Image"", although those two pages were removed after Reuters flagged them to Facebook recently.

Comments still online in one private group with nearly 100,000 members.

Facebook acknowledged in 2018 that its platform was used to incite violence against the Rohingya in Myanmar, and last year spent more than US$3.7 billion on safety and security on its platform.

But the surge of anti-Rohingya comment in Malaysia shows how xenophobic speech nonetheless persists.

""Assertions that Facebook is uncommitted to addressing safety and security are inaccurate and do not reflect the significant investment we've made to address harmful content on our platform,"" a company spokesperson told Reuters.

Reuters found more than three dozen pages and groups, including accounts run by former and serving Malaysian security officials, that featured discriminatory language about Rohingya refugees and undocumented migrants.

Dozens of comments encouraged violence.

Reuters found some of the strongest comments in closed private groups, which people have to ask to join. Such groups have been a hotbed for hate speech and misinformation in other parts of the world.

Facebook removed 12 of the 36 pages and groups flagged by Reuters, and several posts. Five other pages with anti-migrant content seen by Reuters in the last month were removed before Reuters queries.

""We do not allow people to post hate speech or threats of violence on Facebook and we will remove this content as soon as we become aware of it,"" Facebook said.

Some of the pages that remain online contain comments comparing Rohingya to dogs and parasites. Some disclosed where Rohingya had been spotted and encouraged authorities and the public to take action against them.

Widespread hate speech

""This kind of hate speech can lead to physical violence and persecution of a whole group. We saw this in Myanmar,"" said John Quinley, senior human rights specialist at Fortify Rights, an independent group focused on Southeast Asia.

""It would be irresponsible to not actively take down anti-refugee and anti-Rohingya Facebook groups and pages.""

Muslim-majority Malaysia was long friendly to the Rohingya, a minority fleeing persecution in largely Buddhist Myanmar, and more than 100,000 Rohingya refugees live in Malaysia, even though it doesn't officially recognise them as refugees.

But sentiment turned in April, with the Rohingya being accused of spreading the coronavirus. Hate speech circulated widely, including on Facebook – a platform used by nearly 70 percent of Malaysia's 32 million people.

Rights groups and refugees said comments on Facebook helped escalate xenophobia in Malaysia.

""Malaysians who have lived with Rohingya refugees for years have started calling the cops on us, some have lost jobs. We are in fear all the time,"" said Abu, a Rohingya refugee who did not want to give his full name fearing repercussions.

Another refugee who declined to be identified said he deactivated his Facebook account after his details were posted and Malaysians messaged him telling him to go back to Myanmar - from where he fled five years ago.

""Facebook has failed, they don't understand how dangerous such comments can be,"" he said, referring to posts he had seen supporting action in Myanmar against Rohingya.

'Absent'

Rights groups said Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin had failed to do enough to curb xenophobia as it rounded up thousands of undocumented migrants and said it would no longer accept Rohingya refugees.

""The Malaysian government was completely absent from any sort of effort to try to curtail this wave of hate speech,"" said Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director Phil Robertson (below).

Muhyiddin's office did not respond to requests for comment.

Reuters found four pages with links to security and enforcement agencies voicing anti-immigrant sentiment.

""Let us not suffer the cancer of this ethnic (group),"" administrators of a group called ""Friends of Immigration"" posted. The group says it is run by current and former immigration officials.

That post from April was removed this month after Reuters queries to Facebook.

The Immigration Department did not respond to Reuters queries. The communications and home ministries also did not respond to queries on hate speech in social media.

Among the earliest posts to draw comments calling for Rohingya to be shot was one from the Malaysian Armed Forces headquarters asking the public to be its ""ears and eyes"" and report undocumented migrants. A military spokesperson confirmed the authenticity of the page.

Another post that was shared more than 26,000 times was from a page calling itself the Military Royal Intelligence Corps that said undocumented migrants ""will bring problems to all of us"".

Reuters was unable to contact the administrator of the page. The military said it had nothing to do with the page and it was run by a former member of the intelligence unit.

Facebook removed both posts after Reuters queries. The Intelligence Corps page was also taken down.

"KUALA LUMPUR: It is unfair for Malaysia to be on the receiving end in the conflict between the Myanmar government and the Rohingya minority, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Abdul Razak said.

While asserting that the government would continue its fight for the Rohingya cause, he said the conflict - which had killed thousands and displaced many others - need to be tackled at its source.

""Malaysia has always been upholding the principle of the sanctity of life, but at the same time we cannot be hosting so many people (Rohingya refugees) in this country,"" he said.

""It is very unfair for the affected parties to inflict more cause for Malaysia to manage and recieve these people whereby they should be allowed the fundamental and universal rights which have been denied to them,"" he told a press conference after chairing the BN supreme council meeting at Menara Dato Onn.

A recent offensive by the Myanmar authorities in the troubled Rakhine state had reportedly killed more than 400 people, raising questions of a possible movement of Rohingya refugees into the country.

Malaysia has always taken a strong stand against the purported oppression by Myanmar authorities against the Rohingya minority there, with Najib himself leading a movement last year in protest against the violence.

There are about 40,000 displaced Rohingyas living in Malaysia.

Najib said the government would be monitoring and managing the crisis in Myanmar on a humanitarian basis, rather than a religion-driven issue.

He added the government would consider its future course of action through the international stage, whether through Asean, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation or the United Nations.

Najib said a humanitarian mission, which will be launched by him tomorrow, would provide the necessary assistance to the Rohingya refugees that had fled to neighbouring Bangladesh.

The recent wave of Rohingya refugees arriving here are listed as undocumented migrants, largely doing informal work and assisted by local NGOs. Malaysia is not a signatory to the United Nations Convention relating to the status of refugees.

Mahathir further said Malaysia should condemn Myanmar and its de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi by imposing trade sanctions for oppressing the Rohingya.

"BANGKOK, April 2 (Reuters) : Thailand has slightly hardened its language on Myanmar by saying it is ""gravely concerned"" about escalating bloodshed since a Feb. 1 coup, but close military ties and fears of a flood of refugees mean it is unlikely to go further, analysts say.That leaves Thailand out of step with some members of the 10-strong Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean), as they seek to ramp up pressure on the junta, but could also position it as a possible mediator.""(Thailand’s position) is difficult, but I think there is an opportunity because we’ve become an important partner,"" Panitan Wattanayagorn, a political scientist at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University, told Reuters.The closeness of the Thai and Myanmar armies was underscored by a request from Myanmar's junta leader, Min Aung Hlaing, to Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha to ""support democracy"" within days of ousting elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Prayut, who voiced that support, had himself seized power in a 2014 coup when army chief, before taking on his current civilian role in 2019 and rejecting opposition accusations that the vote was manipulated.The personal relationship began much earlier: within armies that appear to have long put behind them the historic rivalry between countries that used to be known as Burma and Siam.In 2018, Min Aung Hlaing was awarded Thailand's King Grand Cross of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant ""in honour of the support he has shown for the Thai military,"" the Bangkok Post said at the time.""For them, the military brotherhood is very, very important,"" said Lalita Hingkanonta, a history professor at Thailand's Kasetsart University.""I don't think that the escalation of violence will change the decision of the Thai government to accept more refugees...I think they just want to be friends with Myanmar more.""Thailand potentially has more at stake in Myanmar than any other member of Asean, as it shares a 2,400-km (1,500-mile) border that is also Myanmar's longest with any neighbour.The geographical position, and a tradition of cautious diplomacy have been reasons for its particular care in remarks on the coup - only toughening its wording slightly after the civilian death toll topped 500 in Myanmar's crackdown on anti-coup protesters.Thailand's wording has still been much milder than that of Asean democracies Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore.The border risks were highlighted by a surge of several thousand refugees this week fleeing bombing by Myanmar's forces of ethnic Karen rebels, an exodus reminiscent of the tens of thousands who fled Myanmar's wars in previous decades.Although Thailand denied that the latest refugees were being pushed back, they complained of having been blocked by Thai border guards, while a local Thai official told a meeting that it was official policy to bar their entry.While Thailand might come under diplomatic pressure to accept refugees or take a tougher stance, Lalita said Prayuth's government was unlikely to be moved.""They would do something to respond to the international pressure, they would do some small things, just to show that, hey, we are responding very well to your concern. But that's it.""Business links are also strong.Foreign direct investment by Thai businesses ranks behind only China and Singapore, with more than $11 billion approved since 1988.Annual cross-border trade stood at more than $9 billion in 2019 and many Thai businesses rely on Myanmar migrant workers - who officially number 1.6 million.Thailand matters even more for Myanmar, accounting for nearly a quarter of exports in 2019, mostly natural gas.But Thailand was unlikely to use its potential economic leverage with any sanctions on trade, said Piti Srisangnam, of the Asean Studies Center at Chulalongkorn University.He suggested Thailand might best pursue diplomacy behind the scenes, to try to encourage Myanmar's generals to curb violence and launch talks with ousted civilians now locked up or branded as traitors.""If you have one friend you've known for a very long time, and one day he commits murder, it doesn't mean you won't be friends with him, right?"" he said.""You are still friends, but the best thing is to talk to him, to show that the thing he has done is very wrong."" - Reuters",,,An Analysis - Myanmar's neighbour Thailand unlikely to toughen stance on coup,,0,0,1
"Malaysia will deport 1,200 detained Myanmar nationals after the Myanmar military government, which took over in a Feb 1 coup, offered to send three navy ships to pick them up, officials from both countries and two sources told Reuters.

Myanmar, via its embassy in Kuala Lumpur (above), made the offer to take back its citizens held in Malaysian immigration detention centres last week, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

The detention centres typically hold asylum-seekers and refugees, along with others who are in Malaysia without proper documents. Malaysia does not formally recognise refugees, regarding them as undocumented migrants.

The officials did not respond to queries as to whether those being repatriated included refugees.

Detainees have in the past included members of the Chin, Kachin and the Muslim Rohingya communities fleeing ethnic conflict and persecution by the military in Myanmar.

Malaysia is home to more than 154,000 asylum-seekers from Myanmar, according to the UN refugee agency UNHCR. There are also thousands of migrant workers.

The sources said Myanmar had offered to take back only its citizens. Myanmar recognises over 100 ethnic groups but not the Rohingya, who are seen as illegal migrants from Bangladesh.

The sources, who requested anonymity, said the navy ships were expected to arrive in Malaysia on Feb. 21 and leave two days later.

Immigration director-general Khairul Dzaimee Daud confirmed the details, adding that authorities had agreed to hand over the detainees to Myanmar’s navy.

“Yes, we have agreed. All of them are from immigration depots,” he said in a text message, without elaborating.

Win Min Soe, a labour attaché at the Myanmar embassy, also confirmed Myanmar’s offer.

Spokespersons for the Prime Minister’s Office and Foreign Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. - Reuters",,,"Malaysia to hand over 1,200 Myanmar detainees to country's navy",,0,0,0
"PUTRAJAYA, Jan 28 — The Court of Appeal here today awarded a Myanmar refugee almost RM1.7 million in damages in a medical negligence lawsuit. A three-member bench comprising Justices Datuk Kamardin Hashim, Datuk Seri Kamaludin Md Said and Datuk Nor Bee Ariffin allowed Henry Siang Len’s appeal on the quantum of damages, raising it to RM1,685,594 from RM734,000 awarded by the High Court previously. Justice Kamardin awarded a sum of RM951,514 in future general damages and increased the High Court costs to RM159,730 from RM50,000 as well as interest on the damages. He also maintained the awards granted by the High Court that is RM234,000 in special damages and RM500,000 in general damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenities of life. Meanwhile, Justice Kamardin dismissed the appeal by the respondent (Hospital Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (HUKM) and two doctors against the High Court’s ruling that Dr Caroline Gunn could represent Siang Len and was properly authorised to act as his litigation representative. Justice Kamardin also ordered the case to be remitted to the same High Court judge for direction on the management of the judgment sum and also awarded RM20,000 costs for the Court of Appeal proceeding. Siang Len, 30, through his litigation representative Dr Gunn had filed the suit in 2016 against HUKM, Dr Aminuddin Abdul Rashid and Dr Nazhatul Muna Ahmad Nasaruddin. According to the facts of the case, Siang Len was to join his wife to resettle in the United States, but on Dec 24, 2010, the night before he was to fly to the USA, he was assaulted by a group of people. As a result of the assault, he suffered injuries in his mouth and also a fracture of his mandible and had sought treatment at HUKM. Following a serious disastrous event at the hospital, Siang Len suffered severe and irreversible brain damage and was given a massive overdose of a powerful anaesthetic drug, Ketamine, five times the intended dose. Siang Len is currently in a minimally conscious state and is dependent on others for all activities of daily living. Following his discharge from hospital in 2011, he had been left under the care of Perch 1, a nursing home for refugees. In January last year, the High Court allowed Siang Len’s claim and awarded damages and costs in the sum of RM784,000. The High Court had, however, dismissed his claim for future general damages, pre-trial damages, aggravated damages and interest. Siang Len was represented by a team of lawyers led by PS Ranjan while the counsel N. Sharmini represented the respondents. — Bernama",,,Court awards almost RM1.7m in damages to Myanmar refugee in negligence suit,,0,0,0
"KUALA LUMPUR, April 13 — A GoFundMe page has been set up to help Hassan al-Kontar, the Syrian stranded at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 for more than a month, leave Malaysia. Set up by Laurie Cooper of the Canada Caring Society, the fund is supported by a group of global volunteers in an effort to help Hassan reach Ecuador, as it is one of the few countries that allow entry to Syrians without the need of a visa. Six flights are needed to reach Ecuador. Hassan would have to transit through the Middle East to Brazil and Peru, and the flights cost RM16,937, while an additional RM6,159 in funds is a prerequisite for him to be granted entry into the Middle East. At the time of writing, RM12,000 out of the RM23,000 target has been reached. Among the volunteers helping Hassan is Refugee Buddy Network founder Lynda Elliott who told Malay Mail that on top of the funds from the GoFundMe page, a separate donation of money and clothes was making its way to Hassan. She added that a local representative would be reaching out to Hassan to pass him the items. However she stressed that the person would like to remain anonymous. Hassan, who received a three-month visa to stay in Malaysia in January 2018, cannot re-enter the country until 2023 as he overstayed his term.
