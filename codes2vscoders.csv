Speaking to the press after visiting the president, Tan revealed that Erdogan has agreed to provide a piece of land to the Tzu Chi Foundation of which he is a volunteer, for the purpose of building a new school for the refugees.

In addition, the president also agreed to provide Advanced Continuing Education (ACE) certificates to up to 3,000 refugee students each year.

This is an increase from the current quota of only 531, which will allow their examination results to be recognised in other countries when furthering their studies.

Currently, some 3,000 Syrian children are pursuing their education at the El Menahil International School, which is deemed by the Turkish government to be over-populated.

Tan, who was ostensibly upbeat and cheerful during the press conference, described the hour-long meeting with Erdogan as “very positive”, saying the president is extremely supportive of Tzu Chi’s plans and works.

“We came here to help Tzu Chi in their bid to assist the refugees, and I think we have achieved much more than we initially expected, especially after we managed to pay a courtesy call on the president.

“Because Tzu Chi did not have access or direct contact with the government, I used whatever contacts I have to meet Erdogan,” he said.

Tan added he is also looking at possibly investing in the tourism sector in Istanbul, and is considering developing a hotel here.

Present at the meeting with the president were, among others, Turkish Ambassador to Malaysia Merve Kavakci, Top Glove Corporation Bhd executive chairman Tan Sri Dr Lim Wee Chai, Berjaya Times Square chief operating officer Morvin Tan, as well as Faisal Hu and wife Nadia Chou, -- a couple who leads Tzu Chi’s Istanbul chapter.

Faisal said Erdogan has agreed to arrange further meetings between his office and Tzu Chi on the proposal to allocate a land for the new school and the plan to register the students under ACE.

He said although it would take some time to build a new school, it is a “dream come true” for Tzu Chi and the students in particular.

The current school (El Menahil International School) was set up by the Sultangazi government, Syrian teachers and Tzu Chi in 2015 and provides classes for all levels of primary, elementary and secondary.

Meanwhile, Lim said Erdogan would consider allowing Top Glove, to build a glove factory in Turkey, that would subsequently provide job opportunities to between 500 and 1,000 individuals.

“We even suggested that maybe a portion of this job openings be provided to the Syrian refugees. And he is very receptive of this proposal,” Lim said.

Tan and Lim are currently on a special three-day mission to Syria, along with 25 Malaysian Tzu Chi volunteers, to provide financial assistance and other aid to the refugees here.",16,6.524390243902439,3.248207885304659,8.046783625730994,0.0027038923473558444,0.0032482078853046594

Shockingly, Selayang Baru in Gombak is now suddenly placed as the seventh lockdown area under an enhanced movement control order (MCO). This adds to the growing fear that people can suddenly find themselves placed under severe restrictions without enough supplies.

ADS

Unfortunately, this has been implemented by invoking Section 18 of the National Security Council (NSC) Act, granting the council-wide and unfettered powers to declare a ""state of emergency"" in a designated area (also known as security area).

However, to suddenly declare lockdown areas and yet fail to ensure the continued supply of food, as seen in parts of Selayang after it was placed under the enhanced MCO, shows the lack of preparedness of the government to guarantee food security.

Recently I received two requests for aid from residents in Selayang who are in desperate need of food supplies. Residents there are placed under a stressful situation as they are not allowed to leave their homes to buy food and shops were closed without due notice. Many were caught unprepared and do not have enough supplies to last them even for a few days.

ADS

Despite the government’s promise that food will be sent to the area, food delivery was not carried out within 24 hours, leaving many people yet to receive anything.

While I understand the need to act quickly and decisively to isolate particular areas to contain the spread of Covid-19, we must not forget people’s access to food and that they are living in fear because of a lack of information and coordination to guarantee their survival during the enhanced MCO.

There is an urgent need for the government to work together with all parties including NGOs, private sector and elected representatives from all divides to guarantee food access in the designated enhanced MCO areas and also to the vulnerable communities especially the B40 nationwide.

ADS

This enhanced MCO has also brought up several disturbing issues relating to food distribution.

Centralised control over food distribution

The vision of “Shared Prosperity” is seriously tested when aid becomes politicised and food distribution is highly controlled by the government.

It was announced that food baskets will be distributed to each parliamentary constituency for the needy. However, on the ground, it was alleged that the government, through the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development, was selective over where the aid was being distributed.

Many Opposition MPs, including myself, hardly received sufficient quantities of essential food items to be distributed to the needy.

The present government had allegedly cut off all Opposition MPs’ development funds when it came into power. I had to seek my own funding to buy food for the vulnerable in my constituency. I am lucky because many generous Malaysians contributed funds and donations in-kind to help those in need in Petaling Jaya.

However, many of the other Opposition MPs, despite having given out food supplies to many themselves, are struggling to cope with the growing requests for food, especially from enhanced MCO lockdown areas.

Lack of transparency on food distribution

Where have all the food baskets gone to? Cheras MP Tan Kok Wai stumbled upon loads of food baskets that were not distributed but stored for more than a week (below).

Recently, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob denied claims that the value of the government food baskets only came up to RM35, saying that these baskets were from the civil society. Yet, at the same time, he failed to disclose the value of the government’s food baskets, how many were allocated per constituency and to whom they have been given?

Not reaching the deserving poor and marginalised

If the database on who is poor and where they are is available, it would have allowed aid to reach them faster. As civil society, parliamentarians and state assembly representatives struggle to get food on the table for the poor, it is also a stressful process to locate, verify and finally distribute the food.

On many occasions, I stumbled upon people who fell out of the “database” like an elderly woman who depended on her brother who lost his job because of the enhanced MCO, a daily wage-earning single mother who cannot go out to earn money to buy diapers for her paralysed son because of the lockdown, a single mother of seven who struggled to feed her family, and many more.

It also brings up the fact that women suffer the most if they are the single female heads of households.

Migrant workers, refugees and marginalised communities are finding it hard to get food when they are daily wage earners or when employers must stop work due to the enhanced MCO.

I have encountered four migrant workers sharing a single packet of instant noodle a day, while another 200 Bangladesh migrant workers were left to share 100 packets of take-aways between themselves.

I urge the government to take food security and the right to have access to food more seriously and implement the following suggestions:

(i) Decentralise and democratise the distribution of food to allow the Welfare Department to work with parliamentarians, civil society as well as other government agencies to get food quicker to the needy.

(ii) Have an effective, transparent and accessible database so that marginalised communities and the most vulnerable people including the elderly, the disabled and migrant workers do not get left out from receiving aid. This information should be shared right down to the humanitarian groups working on the ground to reduce the possibility of people being left out.

(iii) Utilise the latest technologies such as Big Data, 5G and AI to better coordinate supply chains within industries to help with the manufacturing and production of food, medical supplies and other essential items during the MCO. Build a sustainable domestic food supply in the long run.

(iv) Form a cross-party emergency council made up of professionals and experts in healthcare, social services, investments, banking and food security to build a road map for the implementation of key policies during and post-Covid 19 so that we are better prepared and coordinated for the future.

(v) Activate the Parliament Select Committees to be part of the cross-party emergency council to develop a strategic plan post-Covid-19. The aim is to plan not just for economic recovery and sustainability but to build a more resilient social safety net for all.

Sadly, at times like these, there are Malaysians who are starving and being made to live like in an active warzone without any knowledge of when their situation might change.

For the immediate and in the long term, strategic planning has to start now, otherwise, Malaysia will suffer.

Hassan who landed in Canada at 10.30am today has been granted permanent resident status under Canada’s “Private Sponsorship of Refugees” (PSR) program, said his lawyer Datuk Seri M. Ramachelvan.

The Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program is a Canadian initiative established in 1978 under Operation Lifeline, whereby refugees can resettle in Canada with support and funding from private or joint government-private sponsorship.

Al Kontar’s Canadian legal representative Andrew Brouwer could not be reached for comments.

Al Kontar had on Monday posted a video on Twitter from the Taiwan International Airport that he was on his way to Vancouver, Canada.

“For now, it’s not important where I have been or what went on ... What is important is today and tomorrow. The present and the future,“ he said on Twitter.

“I could not do it without the support and prayers from all of you. I could not do it without the help of my family, my Canadian friend’s family, my lawyer. Thank you all,“ he added.

The military drama called Our Girl follows the adventures of female medics in the British Army. It is understood that the controversial scenes were filmed for the show’s fourth series, which is slated to air in the United Kingdom in April. UK’s The Sun reported sources as claiming the show’s producers hired about 100 Rohingya refugees as extras for just £33 (RM180) a day. Sources also told the tabloid that the refugees were “forced to relive their nightmares” when they were asked to participate in “horrific scenes.” The allegations included being asked to dig “graves” in a real rubbish dump as well as extras collapsing from heat exhaustion after being made to work 12 hours a day. It was also claimed that the extras were “sprayed with an industrial gun to make them look filthy” before they were asked to wade through a river with “terrified babies and children in their arms”. An extra named as Habibah Abdullah who spent 15 days at sea after fleeing Myanmar recounted her on-set experience with her two-year-old daughter to The Sun. Habibah who cannot swim was quoted as saying: “We were in fast-moving water and I was terrified. It took hours to do the scenes and we had to go into the water again and again. “Babies were crying and children all around me were screaming ‘Mummy, mummy.’” Meanwhile, another extra Mubarak Bindi who fled Myanmar after her village was razed to the ground said filming scenes in a replica of a refugee camp brought back “terrible feelings”. “My heart sank when I saw the film set. It reminded me of where I had to live after my village was burned down. “It brought back all the terrible feelings of that time. I felt very upset,” she was quoted as saying by The Sun. Sources told The Sun tabloid that many of the show’s cast and crew were “furious” with the treatment of the “vulnerable” refugees on the set, including its star Michelle Keegan. In a statement to The Sun, a spokesman for the BBC refuted the allegations and said the refugees were paid the standard local rate. The rep for the British broadcaster added that the Our Girl storyline was conceived to shed a light on the plight of the Rohingya. “All the supporting artists were contracted in the normal manner and at rates standard for work in Malaysia, including some Rohingya refugees living in Malaysia. “At no point were any of the artists asked to do anything that would compromise their safety and their welfare was of paramount importance to us,” the spokesman said. The spokesman also addressed the case of the Rohingya extra who collapsed from heat exhaustion, saying that he was attended to by an on-set medic and taken to hospital with a producer. “Filming stopped to allow this to happen and there is no footage of the event in the programme,” he added. Since August 2017, nearly 650,000 Rohingya have fled a military operation in Myanmar’s westernmost Rakhine state described by the UN and US as “ethnic cleansing”.

Ampang Jaya police chief ACP Mohamad Farouk Eshak said the Iraqi who has refugee status under the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was arrested at Ampang Putra near Ampang Jaya here at 11.20pm.

He said a knife believed to be the murder weapon was also recovered.

Mohamad Farouk said the suspect and the 28-year-old victim were colleagues and worked at an Arab restaurant.

He said investigations are ongoing to ascertain what had led to the suspect and victim to be embroiled in a fight which led to the death of the latter.

Mohamad Farouk said police learnt that the African woman had come to Malaysia with her family about nine years ago.

“We managed to solve the case within a day with the arrest of the Iraqi. The suspect is in our custody for the murder investigation under a seven-day remand order,“ he said.

Mohamad Farouk said a post mortem on the victim’s body is ongoing at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital but an initial report revealed that tests showed the woman was positive for Covid-19.

He urged those with information on the case to come forward to assist in the probe.

Right groups raised concerns over the safety of deportees when Malaysia sent back 1,086 Myanmar nationals on Myanmar navy ships last month, just weeks after the military had seized power in a February 1 coup. Detained in Malaysia for immigration offences, they were deported despite a court order halting the plan.

Three Malaysian sources familiar with the matter said the decision to delay a plan to deport a second batch until after a proposed meeting of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) to discuss the Myanmar crisis was taken at a cabinet meeting today. The sources requested anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media. Myanmar this month had offered to send three more navy ships to pick up its people detained in Malaysia, one of the sources said. Malaysia’s foreign ministry directed queries to the home affairs ministry and immigration department, neither of which responded to requests for comment.

Datuk Dr Amar Singh, a senior consultant paediatrician, said polio made a comeback in the country after 12 years because refugees, undocumented children, immigrants and stateless children were not all immunised.

“The real problem in Sabah lies in the fact that we don’t vaccinate these quarters, or rather they are charged money ... if I am not mistaken, RM40 per vaccination,” he said.

“If you are stateless or someone from that category, you won’t have the means to pay that amount of money. That is the problem. If you don’t vaccinate other children, we will harm our own children.

“This is because we create an environment where a sizeable number of stateless and immigrant children are not immunised.”

Amar said the Health Ministry had announced that it would work with other agencies and obtain funds from the Philippines.

“But no, I think we should invest our own money because this is an investment for our own children,” he added.

Similarly, another physician suggested several “stepwise approaches” to provide essential healthcare to non-citizens in Malaysia.

Political opinions on the better treatment of refugees are rare among Umno leaders.

Successive BN governments had never ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention. The only Asean country that is a signatory is the Philippines.

As such, under Malaysian law, refugees have neither legal recognition nor UNHCR-issue identification cards, which can help refugees resettle in other countries.

“Refugees who have gone through forced displacement often face psychological stress from experiences in countries of origin, transit country, and in the country of asylum.

“Maintaining mental health is crucial to the overall wellbeing of individuals. In refugee settings, lack of access to mental health professionals is often a major issue, due to financial constraints and lack of awareness.

“It is also compounded by the lack of specialised expertise in the country dealing with the mental health needs of refugees that arise from their unique circumstances,” said spokesperson Yante Ismail.

Malaysiakini contacted UNHCR Malaysia for comments on the incident early Tuesday morning, which saw two Myanmar children killed while another sibling was seriously injured after they were thrown from a flyover by their father, who then plunged to his death from the same spot.

It was later revealed that the father, 38, had been suffering from depression for about a year after he was unable to find employment and was infected with Covid-19.

Factors contributing to suicide are often complex, and mental health problems do not necessarily lead to suicide.

Although a serious public health problem, suicides are preventable with timely, evidence-based, and often low-cost interventions, according to the World Health Organization.

Yante said refugees in Malaysia can access mental health and psychosocial support services that are provided by UNHCR NGO partners here.

They include the Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation, Health Equity Initiatives, Acts, Humankind, and the QFFD Clinic run by Mercy Malaysia.

Those who wish to engage in the services can find their contact information via UNHCR’s RefugeeMalaysia.org information portal or by clicking here.

According to Yante, UNHCR also has an online psychosocial support group project with the University of New South Wales (UNSW) for refugee women.

Acting on a tip-off, a patrol ship challenged a fishing boat near Saint Martin’s, a small Bangladesh island in the Bay of Bengal, and found the Rohingya on board, coast guard Lieutenant Josel Rana said. “We’ve found 58 refugees and detained two human traffickers on the boat,” he told AFP. About 740,000 Muslim minority Rohingya have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh since a brutal military crackdown in the Buddhist-majority nation began in August 2017. Thousands of refugees attempt to flee the camps each year in pursuit of better opportunities in countries such as Malaysia and Thailand. So far this year, law enforcement agencies in Bangladesh have rescued over 400 Rohingya refugees from coastal villages as they were waiting to board boats bound for Malaysia. But this is the first time in 2019 that Rohingya refugees were rescued at sea, raising concerns that the situation in Bangladesh’s overcrowded camps — home to nearly one million — is worsening. “Such incidents will continue as desperation among the refugees is on the rise,” said Emdadul Haq, a professor at the private North South University in Dhaka. Rana said most of the refugees picked up by the coast guard were from the Kutupalong camp — the largest refugee settlement in the world. Most attempt the journey before March, when the sea is calm before the monsoon season sets in, but experts say traffickers are now convincing the refugees to attempt the trip even in rough waters. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has said the vulnerability of Rohingya to trafficking has increased enormously as livelihoods, support networks, and other fundamental systems are disrupted. — AFP",10,2.9166666666666665,3.4797054597701154,15.730994152046785,0.008475751159507966,0.0034797054597701152

On April 16, the Royal Malaysian Navy prevented a boat carrying an estimated 200 Rohingya refugees from entering Malaysian waters near Langkawi.

A day before that, it was reported that at least two dozen people had died after a ship carrying 382 Rohingya refugees was repeatedly turned back by Malaysian authorities.

They were eventually rescued by the Bangladeshi coastguard, which said they had been adrift for two months.

Sevan noted concerns that the refugees may be infected with Covid-19 but said that can be addressed.

""With screening procedures and social distancing, they can still be saved without jeopardising Malaysia’s public health.

""For example, Cuba has allowed two ships carrying Covid-19 positive passengers to dock in their waters to receive medical assistance, reasoning that health is a human right,"" he said.

Sevan said refugees in Malaysia are not recognised by the government even though they have a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) identification card.

""They do not enjoy rights to work, receive a formal education, nor ready access to public healthcare services.

""Despite these constraints, they still need to sustain themselves and their families, often leading to problems with the authorities. This further complicates their daily lives.

They originate from the coastal state of Rakhine, east of the Bay of Bengal.

According to the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, there are 54,856 registered Rohingya refugees and asylum-seekers in Malaysia as of the end of October.

Refugees are not formally recognised in Malaysia, leaving them vulnerable to human traffickers, labour exploitation and extortion.

Children of refugees are also not allowed to attend government schools and are mostly educated by volunteers.

Transit point

Despite not recognising refugees, Malaysia has become a transit point for refugees, who are processed and transferred in third countries by agencies such as the UNHCR.

Last year Malaysia turned away boats carrying migrants including the Rohingya, but eventually took in 1,018 aboard a boat which tried to dock at Pulau Langkawi.

The boat was among several packed with economic migrants and refugees, who were left at sea by human traffickers following a crackdown in Thailand.

This followed the discovery of mass graves linked to human trafficking on the Thai-Malaysian border.

The 1,018, reportedly from Bangladesh and Myanmar, were placed in the Belantik immigration detention camp in Sik, Kedah.

“I had the chance to speak to some Rohingya UNHCR card holders (in the operation) yesterday. They confessed that they entered Malaysia through the borders of Kedah and Kelantan from Thailand and admitted that it was managed by agents,” he told reporters after the operation at a housing project site in Kubang Menerong, Tasek Gelugor early this morning.

“They also confessed that the agents managed trips to the UNHCR office in Kuala Lumpur for the process of obtaining the card.

“They (Rohingya) did not purchase the (UNHCR) cards, but they paid the agent between RM5,000 and RM7,000 per person, and the agent would take them to the UNHCR office.

“They thought that they purchased the cards but actually, they paid the agents in managing their entry.”

During the raid, the department inspected 36 foreigners working at the site and detained 25 of them, including a woman, for not having travel documents and overstaying.

Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng launched the campaign both on the island and mainland sides with a clarion call to the young and the able to help those aggrieved by the floods to get back on their feet.

He said that there were many obstacles in the way due to the sheer after effects of the floods; from debris and mud leftovers to stalled cars and fallen trees besides the financial losses incurred by the victims.

Last weekend's floods inundated 80% of Penang, and caused at one time up to 9,000 people to be resettled in some 400 flood relief centres.

But with generally good weather over the last seven days, there is a sense of normalcy returning to Penang although there is a weather forecast predicting thunderstorms in many parts of the country.

As of 9am, 566 people from 147 families remained marooned in four relief centres where among the hardest hit was SK Lahar Looi in Tasek Gelugor where the 300 primary schoolchildren lost literally everything – textbooks, stationaries and their classrooms were badly damaged.

The school principal Mohamad Asri said the school welcomes any aid to help ease the burden faced by the families of the students.

Civil societies were up in full force to dispense aid to the victims and to help in the clean up for the worst floods to inundate Penang in decades.

Among those out doing a job, was the national aid group – Mercy Malaysia, who besides offering free healthcare services, are also rounding up volunteers to help in the clean up of homes.

The Centre to Combat Corruption Corruption & Cronyism (C4 Center) northern region coordinator K. Sudhagaran Stanley also pointed out that the floods had not only disrupted the lives of the local residents but foreigners as well.

Stanley said that among those worst hit were the Burmese Rohingya refugees, who have been granted temporary residences here by the United Nations Commission on Refugees.

Stanley said their temporary quarters in Butterworth, was damaged by the surging flood waters.

""It is a double whammy for them. First, they have lost their homes in their homeland of Myanmar and here, they have suffered damages to their temporary homes. Their plight needs attention,"" said Stanley.

Their plight has been taken up by the United Nations, an international rights group and community leaders, who want them moved to more established refugee camps on the mainland. “They will stay at Bhasan Char until they are repatriated to Myanmar,” Mohammed Khorshed Alam Khan, administrator for the district covering the island, told AFP. He said the refugees are well taken care of and have better facilities than in the overcrowded camps in Cox’s Bazar where 700,000 Rohingya fled in 2017 to escape a Myanmar military clampdown. In April, Bangladesh authorities said the Rohingya would be kept on the island in order to stop the spread of coronavirus in the sprawling refugee camps. But Human Rights Watch (HRW) questioned that motivation, and said the refugees were not being treated well. “Bangladesh authorities are using the pandemic as an excuse to detain refugees on a spit of land in the middle of a churning monsoon sea while their families anxiously pray for their return,” said Brad Adams, the organisation’s Asia representative. He also asked why Bangladesh authorities were not giving aid workers access to the island settlement.

Around one million Rohingya have fled Myanmar army crackdowns since 2016 for Bangladesh, where they live in cramped, flood-prone camps now being battered by the seasonal monsoon.

On Monday morning a boat carrying 104 Bangladeshis and Rohingya ran into trouble off the coast of Rakhine state, a Myanmar government spokesman told AFP, eventually breaking apart and forcing the passengers to head for shore.

The vessel was believed to be relatively close to the coast, enabling the refugees to survive.

For some it is likely to be an unexpected and unwelcome return to a state they were forced to run from, carrying accounts of atrocities by Myanmar's army and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists.

""These Muslim people were going from Bangladesh to Malaysia by the boat owned by a Malaysian man,"" spokesman Zaw Htay told AFP on Wednesday.

""Some are Bangladesh citizens, the majority are from the camps... people from Bangladesh who fled,"" he said.

Myanmar denies the Rohingya citizenship and officials do not recognise the term, instead labelling them ""Bengalis"", shorthand for illegal infiltrators from the neighbouring country.

They were taken to Nga Khu Ya camp in Rakhine's Muangdaw district - a purpose-built facility meant to process refugees returning under a discredited repatriation deal with Bangladesh.

Photographs showed the passengers — including women and young children — walking barefoot into Myanmar police trucks with virtually no possessions and drenched under heavy rains.

Passengers had paid people smugglers around US$235 to ferry them to Malaysia with the promise of another US$2,100 once they were able to find work in the Muslim-majority country, Zaw Htay added.

Tens of thousands of Rohingya and Bangladeshi economic migrants are believed to have died at sea in recent years trying to reach Malaysia.

The well worn trafficking route collapsed in 2015, when shallow graves were found at migrant holding camps across the Thai-Malaysian borders.

But boats still make the journey south.

After checks Myanmar will send back the Bangladeshis, Zaw Htay added, and submit the rest for repatriation process to Myanmar ""if they want to follow it"".

Rakhine state remains cut off from independent access, and the UN says conditions there are not right for a safe, voluntary and dignified return.

But the UN signed an agreement with Myanmar last week to begin assessing conditions there — in a bid to help refugees make an informed decision about returning.

Alliance of Chin Refugees chairperson James Bawi Thang Bik said that the fear arises as some of the refugees and asylum seekers who hold United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) cards, were arrested and lumped together with undocumented migrants.

They were hauled in during operations by immigration authorities in tandem with the movement control order (MCO) since March this year, and according to James, they were treated the same as undocumented migrants.

Based on figures by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), there are about 178,450 UNHCR refugees and asylum-seekers in Malaysia. More than half of the figure includes Rohingyas, while there are 22,440 Chins in the country.

""It has been brought to our knowledge that some refugees were arrested and deported on Nov 5, 2020, and there were many arbitrary arrests during the MCO.

""We hope there would be no repeats of such arrests and deportations although the government does not recognise asylum seekers and refugees,"" he said in a media conference in Kuala Lumpur today.

For the record, the Malaysian government does not recognise refugees and they are classified as ""unauthorised migrants holding UNHCR cards.""

Klang MP Charles Santiago, who was at the media conference, wants the government to explain the difference between refugees and undocumented migrants.

He wished to raise the matter in Parliament and to meet Home Minister Hamzah Zainuddin to help the refugees from being deported.

""Clearly refugees are in a different category. They run from persecution and murder. But they were held together with undocumented migrants.

""When you deport refugees, death awaits them in their home country.

""On the other hand, when you deport undocumented migrants, they just return to blend in with our society,"" he said.

Charles stressed that the government contradicted itself when it welcomed Rohingyas to seek refuge in the country but they are now labelled as ""illegal.""

""They are not here to steal our land. If you ask them about their dream, it's to go back to their country once it achieves peace. They are here temporarily before moving out to a third country,"" he said.

Some of the refugees, he said, are scientists, engineers and lecturers who could help contribute to Malaysia while they are still here.

""But we (the authorities) look at them as posing a security threat,"" he said.

Meanwhile, James urged the UNHCR to expedite the registration process for undocumented refugees and asylum seekers especially for those who have applied online.

Comments still online in one private group with nearly 100,000 members.

Facebook acknowledged in 2018 that its platform was used to incite violence against the Rohingya in Myanmar, and last year spent more than US$3.7 billion on safety and security on its platform.

But the surge of anti-Rohingya comment in Malaysia shows how xenophobic speech nonetheless persists.

""Assertions that Facebook is uncommitted to addressing safety and security are inaccurate and do not reflect the significant investment we've made to address harmful content on our platform,"" a company spokesperson told Reuters.

Reuters found more than three dozen pages and groups, including accounts run by former and serving Malaysian security officials, that featured discriminatory language about Rohingya refugees and undocumented migrants.

Dozens of comments encouraged violence.

Reuters found some of the strongest comments in closed private groups, which people have to ask to join. Such groups have been a hotbed for hate speech and misinformation in other parts of the world.

Facebook removed 12 of the 36 pages and groups flagged by Reuters, and several posts. Five other pages with anti-migrant content seen by Reuters in the last month were removed before Reuters queries.

""We do not allow people to post hate speech or threats of violence on Facebook and we will remove this content as soon as we become aware of it,"" Facebook said.

Some of the pages that remain online contain comments comparing Rohingya to dogs and parasites. Some disclosed where Rohingya had been spotted and encouraged authorities and the public to take action against them.

Widespread hate speech

""This kind of hate speech can lead to physical violence and persecution of a whole group. We saw this in Myanmar,"" said John Quinley, senior human rights specialist at Fortify Rights, an independent group focused on Southeast Asia.

""It would be irresponsible to not actively take down anti-refugee and anti-Rohingya Facebook groups and pages.""

Muslim-majority Malaysia was long friendly to the Rohingya, a minority fleeing persecution in largely Buddhist Myanmar, and more than 100,000 Rohingya refugees live in Malaysia, even though it doesn't officially recognise them as refugees.

But sentiment turned in April, with the Rohingya being accused of spreading the coronavirus. Hate speech circulated widely, including on Facebook – a platform used by nearly 70 percent of Malaysia's 32 million people.

Rights groups and refugees said comments on Facebook helped escalate xenophobia in Malaysia.

""Malaysians who have lived with Rohingya refugees for years have started calling the cops on us, some have lost jobs. We are in fear all the time,"" said Abu, a Rohingya refugee who did not want to give his full name fearing repercussions.

Another refugee who declined to be identified said he deactivated his Facebook account after his details were posted and Malaysians messaged him telling him to go back to Myanmar - from where he fled five years ago.

""Facebook has failed, they don't understand how dangerous such comments can be,"" he said, referring to posts he had seen supporting action in Myanmar against Rohingya.

'Absent'

Rights groups said Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin had failed to do enough to curb xenophobia as it rounded up thousands of undocumented migrants and said it would no longer accept Rohingya refugees.

""The Malaysian government was completely absent from any sort of effort to try to curtail this wave of hate speech,"" said Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director Phil Robertson (below).

Muhyiddin's office did not respond to requests for comment.

Reuters found four pages with links to security and enforcement agencies voicing anti-immigrant sentiment.

""Let us not suffer the cancer of this ethnic (group),"" administrators of a group called ""Friends of Immigration"" posted. The group says it is run by current and former immigration officials.

That post from April was removed this month after Reuters queries to Facebook.

The Immigration Department did not respond to Reuters queries. The communications and home ministries also did not respond to queries on hate speech in social media.

Among the earliest posts to draw comments calling for Rohingya to be shot was one from the Malaysian Armed Forces headquarters asking the public to be its ""ears and eyes"" and report undocumented migrants. A military spokesperson confirmed the authenticity of the page.

Another post that was shared more than 26,000 times was from a page calling itself the Military Royal Intelligence Corps that said undocumented migrants ""will bring problems to all of us"".

Reuters was unable to contact the administrator of the page. The military said it had nothing to do with the page and it was run by a former member of the intelligence unit.

Facebook removed both posts after Reuters queries. The Intelligence Corps page was also taken down.

In May 1975, the first boat with 47 refugees arrived in Malaysia from Vietnam. More than 200,000 of them had resided or passed through a refugee camp in Pulau Bidong, Terengganu, from 1978 to 1991.

The recent wave of Rohingya refugees arriving here are listed as undocumented migrants, largely doing informal work and assisted by local NGOs. Malaysia is not a signatory to the United Nations Convention relating to the status of refugees.

Mahathir further said Malaysia should condemn Myanmar and its de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi by imposing trade sanctions for oppressing the Rohingya.

""At the same time, we must expose the atrocities committed by Myanmar (against the Rohingya) to the world,"" he said.

The detention centres typically hold asylum-seekers and refugees, along with others who are in Malaysia without proper documents. Malaysia does not formally recognise refugees, regarding them as undocumented migrants.

The officials did not respond to queries as to whether those being repatriated included refugees.

Detainees have in the past included members of the Chin, Kachin and the Muslim Rohingya communities fleeing ethnic conflict and persecution by the military in Myanmar.

Malaysia is home to more than 154,000 asylum-seekers from Myanmar, according to the UN refugee agency UNHCR. There are also thousands of migrant workers.

The sources said Myanmar had offered to take back only its citizens. Myanmar recognises over 100 ethnic groups but not the Rohingya, who are seen as illegal migrants from Bangladesh.

The sources, who requested anonymity, said the navy ships were expected to arrive in Malaysia on Feb. 21 and leave two days later.

Immigration director-general Khairul Dzaimee Daud confirmed the details, adding that authorities had agreed to hand over the detainees to Myanmar’s navy.

A three-member bench comprising Justices Datuk Kamardin Hashim, Datuk Seri Kamaludin Md Said and Datuk Nor Bee Ariffin allowed Henry Siang Len’s appeal on the quantum of damages, raising it to RM1,685,594 from RM734,000 awarded by the High Court previously. Justice Kamardin awarded a sum of RM951,514 in future general damages and increased the High Court costs to RM159,730 from RM50,000 as well as interest on the damages. He also maintained the awards granted by the High Court that is RM234,000 in special damages and RM500,000 in general damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenities of life. Meanwhile, Justice Kamardin dismissed the appeal by the respondent (Hospital Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (HUKM) and two doctors against the High Court’s ruling that Dr Caroline Gunn could represent Siang Len and was properly authorised to act as his litigation representative. Justice Kamardin also ordered the case to be remitted to the same High Court judge for direction on the management of the judgment sum and also awarded RM20,000 costs for the Court of Appeal proceeding. Siang Len, 30, through his litigation representative Dr Gunn had filed the suit in 2016 against HUKM, Dr Aminuddin Abdul Rashid and Dr Nazhatul Muna Ahmad Nasaruddin. According to the facts of the case, Siang Len was to join his wife to resettle in the United States, but on Dec 24, 2010, the night before he was to fly to the USA, he was assaulted by a group of people. As a result of the assault, he suffered injuries in his mouth and also a fracture of his mandible and had sought treatment at HUKM. Following a serious disastrous event at the hospital, Siang Len suffered severe and irreversible brain damage and was given a massive overdose of a powerful anaesthetic drug, Ketamine, five times the intended dose. Siang Len is currently in a minimally conscious state and is dependent on others for all activities of daily living. Following his discharge from hospital in 2011, he had been left under the care of Perch 1, a nursing home for refugees. In January last year, the High Court allowed Siang Len’s claim and awarded damages and costs in the sum of RM784,000. The High Court had, however, dismissed his claim for future general damages, pre-trial damages, aggravated damages and interest. Siang Len was represented by a team of lawyers led by PS Ranjan while the counsel N. Sharmini represented the respondents. — Bernama",15,5.524390243902439,0.5847953216374269,4.763832658569501,0.0018572447011966865,0.0005847953216374269
Syrian stranded in KLIA gets support from international NGOs,3,"['Volunteers are helping a refugee to leave Malaysia', 'Refugee identity of article subject is peripheral ', 'Refugees in Malaysia depend on donations to survive']","[379, 377, 35]",1.8333333333333333,1342,"[29, -1, 54, 185]",0,"KUALA LUMPUR, April 13 — A GoFundMe page has been set up to help Hassan al-Kontar, the Syrian stranded at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 for more than a month, leave Malaysia. Set up by Laurie Cooper of the Canada Caring Society, the fund is supported by a group of global volunteers in an effort to help Hassan reach Ecuador, as it is one of the few countries that allow entry to Syrians without the need of a visa. Six flights are needed to reach Ecuador. Hassan would have to transit through the Middle East to Brazil and Peru, and the flights cost RM16,937, while an additional RM6,159 in funds is a prerequisite for him to be granted entry into the Middle East. At the time of writing, RM12,000 out of the RM23,000 target has been reached. Among the volunteers helping Hassan is Refugee Buddy Network founder Lynda Elliott who told Malay Mail that on top of the funds from the GoFundMe page, a separate donation of money and clothes was making its way to Hassan. She added that a local representative would be reaching out to Hassan to pass him the items. However she stressed that the person would like to remain anonymous. Hassan, who received a three-month visa to stay in Malaysia in January 2018, cannot re-enter the country until 2023 as he overstayed his term.
